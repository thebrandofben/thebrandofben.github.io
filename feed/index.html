<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>



<p style="text-align:center">Progressive Overload</p>



<p>For a long time, I just went into the gym and worked hard for as long as I wanted, and then left.  I didn&#8217;t keep track of how much weight I used each day or whether it was increasing or decreasing over the long term. I knew some general principles about how weight training works, so I started from the basics. Your body increases muscle size and strength to adapt to greater needs for size and strength. As you get bigger and stronger, you have to gradually increase the demands you put on your muscles to get them to continue to build and adapt. This concept is called <strong><span title="the need to gradually increase the demands you put on your muscles to get them to continue to build and adapt">progressive overload</span></strong>. It is the general principle on which all successful workout programs are designed. Simply: as you get fitter, you have to make sure you&#8217;re lifting more weight, or stretching deeper, or running farther to continue getting fitter.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Inspiration from Wendler 5/3/1</p>



<p>One of the most popular workout plans built on the premise of progressive overload, which has truly stood the test of time, is called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Wendler 5/3/1 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.lift.net/workout-routines/wendler-5-3-1/" target="_blank">Wendler 5/3/1</a>. I like many of the fundamentals of this plan due to how customizable it is. It provides a core framework based on powerlifting around which you can design your own &#8216;assistance work.&#8217; The foundations of Wendler 5/3/1 that I liked and decided to take inspiration from are:</p>



<ol><li>Periodization &#8211; Rather than a continuous, linear periodization in which weights or reps constantly and slowly increase, Jim Wendler opts for a fluctuation format. In this format, you work up from a smaller percentage of maximum effort on a cyclic basis. For example, you may be working from 80% of max at the beginning of each month up to 95% of your calculated maximum at the end of each month.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Periodization.jpg"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Periodization-1024x567.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-982" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Periodization-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Periodization-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Periodization-768x425.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Periodization.jpg 1348w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Visual Representation of Linear vs Fluctuating Periodization</figcaption></figure>



<p><ol>2. The &#8216;5/3/1 Philosophy&#8217; &#8211; Jim Wendler constantly stresses three things that make his program so successful: start light, progress slowly, and emphasize big compound lifts. These make sense intuitively! Start light to let the body get used to the movement patterns, rep ranges, and work load. Progress slowly because fitness, health, and self-improvement are lifelong activities and sustainable practices fit them better than sporadically trying to play catch up. And finally, emphasizing big compound lifts such as bench, deadlift, and squat that utilize multiple joints and large muscle groups all at once. This increases the efficiency of time spent in the gym, tends to have great crossover to isolation exercises which use a single muscle group or joint, and gets your body working in concert.</ol></p>



<p><ol>3. AMRAP &#8211; These are basically opposites as far as the toll they take on your system! The 5/3/1 program calls for adherents to complete as many reps as possible on their final (and heaviest) set of each primary lift. This requires a certain amount of self-awareness and fortitude that many other workout programs don&#8217;t incorporate, and it also makes it more accommodating. It requires, and improves, your self-awareness and fortitude by making you push your body but also making you listen to what it&#8217;s telling you. You can really learn what your body and mind are capable of when you crank out a 12 rep set when your workout called for just 5. It also makes the program capable of adjustment to your best and worst workout days; whether you got a bad night of sleep, or you have a grudge to take out on the bar that day.</ol></p>



<p style="text-align:center">Making it Mine</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also a certain amount I wanted to figure out on my own. There&#8217;s a reason Wendler 5/3/1 isn&#8217;t the only workout program out there! Different people have different capabilities, goals, equipment, and just basic workout preferences. Here&#8217;s where I wanted to differ from his program, and why:</p>



<ol><li>Rep ranges &#8211; The rep ranges of Wendler&#8217;s program are its namesake, calling for sets of five, three, or just a heavy single depending on the week. But somebody may feel more comfortable doing sets of eight for deadlifts, or sets of ten or more for bench. Additionally, many argue that singles are only a good way to <em>test </em>strength, not to <em>build </em>it, and I believe there&#8217;s an increased risk of injury while doing low rep work at a high percentage of your one rep max. </li><li>Functional Percentage of One Rep Max &#8211; Based on some reverse engineering of the program, I found that each block (as written by Wendler) is based on 86% of your maximum. After doing some research on other popular programs and studies, I decided to adjust that percentage to increase from about 87% to 94% for each block.</li><li>Customization &#8211;  I wanted to be able to adjust this for people who, like myself, know what exercises and rep ranges treat them best. I wanted this to be good guidance for the core of a program in which the rest of the workout could be adapted to any goals. And I wanted it to be intuitive and easy to use.</li></ol>



<h4 id="program">The Program!</h4>



<p style="text-align:center">How to Use</p>



<p><strong>The orange cells</strong> are the only cells you should edit! They will have cascading effect on the rest of the template. IF NEEDED: change the exercises, starting maxes, the number of reps you want to do for each exercise, and if you want to get technical, the functional percentages week-by-week. </p>



<p>Donâ€™t know your max lifts? Use the handy dandy 1RM calculator below the template and base it on your recent workouts. Still not sure? Shoot low, stick with the program for 4 weeks, and then use the 1RM calculator at the end to determine where you should be.   </p>



<p>Next screenshot, print, or write down your sets and VOILA you have the core workouts of your program for the next month.</p>



<p><a href="#continuing">If you&#8217;re coming back to this page after completing a month: add five or ten pounds to your prior maximum, then go out and crush those weights for another four weeks!</a></p>

<h4 id="discussion">Discussion</h4>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>The First Thing Many People Need to Hear &amp; Change</strong></p>



<p><strong>Fitness goals are more dependent on what you do in the kitchen than what you do in the gym.</strong> Every change that you make in the right direction is progress! Don&#8217;t short yourself on your potential by focusing too much on your workouts and not enough on your diet.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Choosing Primary, Programmed Exercises</p>



<p>The Wendler 5/3/1 program calls for squats, deadlifts, bench, and overhead press as the four big lifts. For lower body exercises, I like to alternate squats with front squats and I definitely prefer sumo deadlift over conventional. I always opt for incline or decline bench over flat bench. I like to do a lateral pulldown movement instead of military press in an effort to keep a balance among pulling and pushing motions for my shoulders.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no wrong answer! Many people have physical, flexibility or mobility restrictions that rule out certain exercises. I personally prefer doing exercises with free weights and a full (but comfortable) range of motion. Some exercise options include:</p>



<ul><li>Squat: front squat, high bar squat, low bar squat, pause squats</li><li>Deadlift: sumo deadlift, conventional deadlift, Romanian deadlift, trap bar deadlift, rack pulls, dumbbell deadlifts</li><li>Bench: pushups (weighted), incline bench, decline bench, flat bench, dumbbell bench</li><li>Military: standing military press, seated military press, push press, dumbbell seated shoulder press, dumbbell standing shoulder press, Arnold press</li><li>Lat Pulldowns: neutral grip pulldowns, underhand grip pulldowns, overhand grip pulldowns, wide grip pulldowns, narrow grip pulldowns</li></ul>



<p style="text-align:center">Choosing Rep Ranges</p>



<p>Find what works for you through trial and error! It takes a long time in the gym to get to know your body. For me, the 2-6 rep range for squat and deadlift variations leave me feeling like I got the best workout. The 10-12 rep range on bench variations leave me feeling the most pumped with the least toll on my shoulders and elbows. I like the 8-10 range for back exercises because I can really feel the contraction and muscle activation. Experiment, keep your goals in mind, and track your success! Conventionally, the rep ranges associated with different goals are:</p>



<ul><li>Strength: 1-6 reps per set</li><li>Size: 8-12 reps per set</li><li>Endurance: 15-20 reps per set (not optimized with this plan)</li></ul>



<p>The truth isn&#8217;t quite as cut and dry as this, but it&#8217;s a good general guideline. You activate different neural connections and muscle fibers and make different demands on your body when you exercise at different intensities and speeds.  Are you trying to get heavier with your bench? Do double or triples some  weeks. Are you better off with 5s for squats? Put in 5s. Do you want to  get different types of muscle fiber recruited throughout the program?  Vary rep range from 2-10. </p>



<p style="text-align:center">The Rest of your Workout</p>



<p><strong>Rest periods</strong>: Listen to your body. Let your muscles recover between sets so that your next set is quality. Try not to wait any longer than five minutes, as this will let your body cool down too much. If your cardio and conditioning are decent, you should rarely need to wait longer than three minutes between sets for good performance. I take 3ish minutes before my AMRAP set, more afterwards, and less between all other sets.</p>



<p><strong>Warmup</strong>: Do one! Many advocate for some amount of stretching, some advocate foam rolling, and some call for light cardio to get the blood pumping. Whatever you prefer is great. I like a little cardio to get my temperature up and my blood flowing before getting started. </p>



<p>I also strongly recommend doing warmup sets of your primary exercise. Gradually increase weight until you get to your 3 working sets for the day. Make sure to step up the weight in reasonable amounts. Keep the reps low enough that you don&#8217;t limit your ability to complete your workout at the working sets.</p>



<p><strong>Core work</strong>: Abs, obliques, lower back. I see these overlooked in many workout programs that emphasize strength, yet I&#8217;ve always found my main lifts increase more readily when I put in the time to train my core.</p>



<p><strong>Assistance work</strong>: This is a huge topic to cover. The purpose of this work is to fill in the gaps left by the rest of your programming. It can be there to balance your physique, prevent injury, or strengthen relative weaknesses. I try to do 3ish sets of 10ish reps of 1-3 exercises after I do my main lift of the day. Sometimes I&#8217;ll do a little circuit training. For upper body days, I like pairing complementary muscle groups. Here are some exercises I like to do with my main lifts:</p>



<p>Squat: Front squats if my main lift was back squats (or vice versa), Romanian deadlifts, calf raises, abs</p>



<p>Deadlifts: Hyperextensions, walking lunges (db or bb), calves, abs</p>



<p>Bench: Face pulls, pushups, cable crossovers, rear delt flys, barbell rows, pullovers, tricep pushdowns</p>



<p>Military: Pullups, bicep curls (of all sorts), lateral raises, lateral pulldowns, arnold presses, skullcrushers</p>



<p>Lat pulldowns: db shoulder press, lateral raises, curls, pushdowns, rear delt flys</p>



<p><strong>Lift form</strong>: It&#8217;s hard to decide when you&#8217;ve done &#8216;as many reps as possible&#8217; if you could do more with bad form. For the most part, I advocate doing all lifts with good form without bouncing weight. However, if I can get in an extra rep or two by bouncing weight or letting my form break down a little, I will do so. It&#8217;s very difficult for you to know your actual form and safety with just proprioception! If you want to know how much your form is breaking down and whether you want to risk it, take a video of yourself. When in doubt, be conservative and do less with good form. Doing slightly less in any single workout and avoiding injury is a recipe for greater long-term success.</p>



<p><strong>Lift speed</strong>: Some programs come with lifting cadences which dictate the time of the eccentric, paused, and concentric portions of the range of motion. Instead for this program the user&#8217;s preference is fine. The intention of this program is for a controlled eccentric phase, a minimal pause, and an explosive concentric.</p>



<p><strong>Cardio</strong>: Regardless of workout goals, you should include some! Increases work capacity and therefore improves workouts. It also improves oxygen transport and increases recovery between sets. HIIT is a quicker, more effective, but not necessarily easier way of getting a good cardio workout as compared to steady state cardio.</p>



<p><strong>Frequency</strong>: If you work out less than four times per week, it&#8217;s totally ok to double up on big lifts for a workout. If you eat and sleep enough to recover from your workouts, there&#8217;s nothing fundamentally wrong with working out every day. You should do something active every day, even if it&#8217;s just walking. I try to avoid going for big lifts more than two days in a row, and I try to alternate upper body focused and lower body focused workouts to give those muscle groups a reasonable amount of time to recover.</p>



<p><strong>Stretching &amp; mobility</strong>: Stretching is pretty well proven to NOT reduce soreness. Stretching before a workout has been found to not improve performance. I haven&#8217;t seen scientific evidence that stretching prevents injury. Having said that, my body feels so much better and I feel so much more comfortable when I stretch, foam roll, and practice movements to increase mobility in major joints such as the hips and shoulder.</p>



<p><strong>Mixing it up</strong>: Enjoy your experience in the gym! Include exercises or other practices just because you enjoy them. The best workout is the one that you actually do! It&#8217;s my theory that the success of many popular workout programs is due to having a variety of exercises that change regularly. This also allows you to engage muscles in different ways that can help maintain a more balanced and functional physique.</p>



<p>Equipment substitutions: Barbells, dumbbells, cambered bar, trap bar, machines, and bodyweight exercises</p>



<p>Exercise options: Speed work (10 sets of 2 at 60-65%, explosive), band or chain work, circuit training, Zumba</p>



<p><strong>Track your progress</strong>: Write it down! Write down what you do, how much you do, how hard it is, and how it affects you. Do you have a lot more difficulty doing sets of five, but the same results towards your goals? Do sets of eight leave you so sore that it negatively impacts your next workout? These are things that are hard to notice unless you have it written down. It&#8217;s impossible to know how well something is working unless you know <em>if </em>and <em>how much</em> it&#8217;s working, then comparing it to an alternative.</p>



<p><strong id="continue">Continuing your progress</strong>: After completing a four week block, here&#8217;s what you should do:</p>



<ol><li>Congratulate yourself! You&#8217;re stronger now.</li><li>If you hit at least minimum reps on all sets in week four: Go to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="template (opens in a new tab)" href="http://bit.ly/benstemplate" target="_blank">template</a>, increase your starting max by five pounds for each lift, print it out, and do it again. If this was your first time and you didn&#8217;t properly estimate your starting maxes, enter your top set of each lift from week four into <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this calculator (opens in a new tab)" href="http://bit.ly/onerepmaxcalc" target="_blank">this calculator</a>, then set those as your starting maxes in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="template (opens in a new tab)" href="http://bit.ly/benstemplate" target="_blank">template</a>.</li><li>If you didn&#8217;t hit your minimum reps, and this might sound counterintuitive, take a break. Set your maxes back by ten pounds each, then for this week do three sets of ten reps at 60% of max for each lift while doing limited assistance work. Then, next week, start the program back up again! This will give your body a chance to rest, recover, and adapt that it might have been needing.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Adapt to your goals and lifestyle</strong>: This core program can be used to make progress towards any goals you might have by adapting it to your goals and lifestyle. It can be used on a bulk, on a cut, to get bigger, to get stronger. It can be used if you work out for 25 minutes twice a week.</p>



<p><strong>Diet and supplementation</strong>: WAY beyond the scope of this.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Calculations</p>



<p>All calculated lift numbers are based on Brzycki&#8217;s formula for one rep maxes. Your sets for the day increase by 10% of your one rep max at a time.</p>



<h4 id="contact">Contact</h4>



<p>If you are thinking about starting this program, let me know! I&#8217;d love to go on the journey with you. Tell me what your starting numbers are, and in a couple months (or years), you&#8217;ll look back at those stats and see how far you&#8217;ve come.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think. Tell me what I got right and, more importantly, what I got wrong!

<h2 id="preparation">Preparing for the Trip</h2>



<p style="text-align:center">Jump to: <a href="#planning">Planning</a> &#8211; <a href="#food">Food</a></p>



<h4 id="planning">Choosing a Time &amp; Hike</h4>



<p>Pat and I wanted to go on a backpacking trip, so I told him to take a day off of work for a long weekend, tell me when it would be, and I would make it work. He decided to take off May 3rd, so I tried to plan a hike we could do for May 3rd-5th. I decided that we would hike out of Rockfish Gap due to its ease of access, and I wrote up a couple different hike options in which the 2nd car would be parked in different places:</p>



<ol><li>Rockfish Gap north on the Appalachian Trail (hereafter &#8216;AT&#8217;) until we turn off west onto Riprap Trail going counter-clockwise and then head back south once it meets back up with the AT until we reach car 2 at Jarman Gap</li><li>Rockfish Gap north on the AT until we turn off east onto North Fork Moorman&#8217;s River Trail and follow it down to car 2 at the Charlottesville Reservoir</li></ol>



<p>We decided on option #1! This hike came out to an estimated total of 31.2 miles with a gross elevation gain of 7035&#8242; and 6666&#8242; of downhill. It includes a conservative 7 summits, 2 of which we climb back over.</p>



<h4 id="food">Getting Food Ready</h4>



<p>The normal estimate for hiking food is ~2lbs per person per day. I decided we would be doing a hot dinner and all other food would be eaten on the move. I did some googling and some shopping and here&#8217;s what I came up with:</p>



<p>Breakfast: Cereal! I made a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.zoho.com/file/9ce33393014f78a214dc6ae1bcddbacea944e" target="_blank">breakdown of some of the nutrition information, recipe, and price</a>. The calories, nutrients, price, taste, convenience, and portability of this meal made it a home run. We packed two apiece for this adventure.</p>



<p>Snacks: The preassembled snacks I decided on were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Coconut Clusters (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2VqHsyx" target="_blank">coconut clusters</a> &amp; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2Va4hkZ" target="_blank">Kirkland turkey jerky</a>, both of which I got from Costco, and both of which I split evenly two ways. The snack that I made was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="trail-friendly peanut butter, honey, banana sandwiches (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.zoho.com/file/9ce33380a0b21513d43a9b1eafba999f9da2a" target="_blank">trail-friendly peanut butter, honey, banana sandwiches</a>! Check out that link for price and calorie breakdown as well as the recipe. I used Mission brand, burrito size tortillas, store brand peanut butter, local honey, and dried banana chips from the bulk foods aisle. Coming in at just over a dollar, this snack/meal takes up very little space, keeps well on the trail, tastes good, and has some texture to it! I ended up making four total so we got two each.</p>



<p>Dinner: I love having something hot to end the day when I&#8217;m out on the trail. I decided on some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="fancy ramen (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2DZEoyE" target="_blank">fancy ramen</a> for that purpose. Tasty, easy, and a good way to get calories and electrolytes back in the system after a long day of working hard and sweating. A staggering four packs of ramen each was how I rounded out our needs!</p>



<p>This food came in at exactly 4lbs each, providing 7200 calories. It ended up being the perfect amount of food for me, but Pat had a little left at the end of the hike.</p>

<h4 id="Day1">Day 1 &#8211; Friday, May 3rd &#8211; 15.5 miles</h4>



<p>We dropped off one car at the top of Jarman Gap Road, which it turned out was directly on an AT detour due to power line repairs. Then we got drove the other car out to park at Rockfish Gap and finally got on the trail just after 9am, heading north. The hike started and I could hardly keep up with Pat, who was very excited and wasn&#8217;t quite pacing himself (I hoped) for the hike we had planned. If he was able to sustain that, I would&#8217;ve been toast. We quickly and uneventfully bagged the first couple summits, Scott Mountain and Bears Den Mountain, before taking our first break at the tractor seats by the radio towers at the top of Bears Den. It was a quick one to catch my breath and cool down a bit before we were back on the move. Just past Bears Den Mountain are the beautiful fields at Beagles Gap, which were very cool to hike through. Next we got up Little Calf Mountain which has wonderful meadows and views at the top, quickly followed by its big brother, Calf Mountain, where we added our rocks to the cairn that has accumulated at its peak. On our way down the backside of Calf Mountain we met a trail worker right outside the shelter who had a couple recommendations when we told him our plans and mileage weren&#8217;t set in stone. He suggested we do a quick out-and-back detour when we reached the turn for the South Fork Moorman&#8217;s River Trail to go for a swim at a swimming hole known locally as Blue Hole. Just past him there was a brief detour due to power line repairs in the area that took us right past the car parked on Jarman Gap Road! It made me wish we had left our overnight gear there and daypacked to that point. Now I know for next time! Shortly beyond this was our first water refill stop and more sincere break from hiking at a spring. Pat fell asleep almost instantly while I filtered water, drank a lot of it, and ate the entirety of my jerky. </p>



<p>This great recharge and refresh left us knowing we could get a lot more miles in before we had to call it a day. And right around the next corner, we saw the trail split that we had heard about from the trail worker and we decided to do some exploration for Blue Hole! We added on an extra 4.3mi and 800&#8242; of elevation gain and loss after getting back to our starting point without a single regret nor a single glimpse of Blue Hole. After having just done some retroactive research while writing this up and looking at the gpx file of our trip, we got to within about 500&#8242; horizontally of the swimming hole. Oops! So after this detour we continued north on the Appalachian Trail and the sun started to get low in the sky. The forecast had called for clear skies at night, so we were looking for a campsite that was near a break in the trees to do some stargazing later. The stars have an entirely different look to them when you&#8217;re in the mountains. After being unable to find a campsite that met that criteria, and getting near dark, we camped at the very next campsite we found. We got the tents and sleeping gear set up and, within 10 minutes, it started to rain! That kind of luck stayed with us for the rest of the trip. We got our ramen cooked and eaten, keeping the stove dry and passing the single pot back and forth under my umbrella (one of my new favorite pieces of camping equipment). We ate up, settled down to sleep, and sometime in the night the rain let up.</p>



<h4 id="Day2">Day 2 &#8211; Star Wars Day &#8211; 15.6 miles</h4>



<p>We broke camp and got on the trail just after 7 am, using the last of our water for breakfast and drinking. This was right in the middle of the 12 mile stretch of the AT without water that we&#8217;d heard about people running dry on, and it looked like we were going to get thirsty before we got any water. But not dangerously so! Our first adventure for the day was a packless jaunt out to get the peak of Turk Mountain under our belts, which was a one mile hike each way. Near the peak there are great places to get incredible views back south where we could see each of the mountains we&#8217;d climbed the day before, and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always loved. There are also north facing views where we were able to try to work out where we had left to go. I think if I were to make a recommendation to somebody trying to do this hike, I&#8217;d say you should do this out and back after hiking the sections both north and south of Turk Mountain so that you can see where you&#8217;ve been and know what you&#8217;ve conquered. It always looks like so much more to me after I&#8217;ve done it. </p>



<p>After getting back to our backpacks and the AT, we got a lucky break! Right where the AT crosses Skyline Drive near the Crimora Lake Overlook, we encountered some trail magic! Mechanicsville Scout Troop 555 had run out of water on this stretch previously, so they were set up for the weekend helping improve the experience for other hikers. Shortly after this, we passed the southern turnoff down to Riprap Hollow, where we would later be getting back to the AT. We then passed a few hikers who had seen a rattlesnake right on the trail, and although we were very cautious and attentive after the warning, we didn&#8217;t see or hear a trace. </p>



<p>The hike was uneventful through the rest of the northbound AT, which came to an end when we turned off west toward Riprap trail. This trail takes you past two very picturesque landmarks with great north- and west-facing views: Chimney Rocks and Calvary Rocks. The trail also goes just north of the summit of Rocks Mountain, which is distinctive and clearly visible to your left as you hike past. I wish I had dropped my pack and darted offtrail to get to the top of that one! As the trail continues, it drops down gradually to the valley floor and meets up with a stream which you see sporadically in the areas where it runs above ground. At this point, we had hiked about 10mi straight and I was ready to shrug off my pack and break out the snacks. I saw a nice little side trail to the stream and we went down it and our luck struck again! We were right at Riprap&#8217;s biggest hit: its swimming hole. I saw a snake swimming around, but he looked friendly enough so I wasn&#8217;t worried about it. First thing I wanted to do before cooling down was to jump in that refreshing water! Afterwards I filled my water back up, waited to dry off, and made some quick ramen. We had the place to ourselves when we showed up, which I think is pretty unusual. It was nice to get to rinse off a couple days of dirt and smell, and I got to meet some very cute dogs!</p>



<p>We weren&#8217;t sure how much more distance we were going to be able to put behind us for the day, seeing as the climb out of the hollow along Wildcat Ridge is pretty serious and we aren&#8217;t used to getting that kind of mileage in a day. We ended up doing another 3 miles after the swimming hole and gaining 1300&#8242; in elevation before setting up camp for the night! It was a hell of a climb and we absolutely blitzed it. We found a nice spot to camp for the night just after getting going southbound again on the AT. I spotted a gap in the trees off to our left and it turned out to be an old, overgrown road. Just like the first night, within 10 minutes of getting camp set up, the rain began. We cooked, ate and fell asleep with the sounds of rain and thunder up on the ridge.</p>



<h4 id="Day3">Day 3 &#8211; Cinco de Mayo &#8211; 4.4 miles</h4>



<p>We got started at a similar time the following morning, hitting the trail around 730am. We passed back by sights from the last couple days without anything of particular interest happening. We didn&#8217;t have as much to do this day as I expected! I underestimated our ability on the trail, and as always, when we got back to the car I wasn&#8217;t ready to leave!</p>

<p>We could have gotten more and better pics, but I get so caught up just enjoying the hiking!<br></p>

<p>Many of the markers I placed on the embedded <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="caltopo (opens in a new tab)" href="http://caltopo.com" target="_blank">caltopo</a> map above are self-explanatory. The marker for a detour is where there&#8217;s an official detour due to infrastructure repairs. The blue line is where we went exploring looking for Blue Hole that we&#8217;d heard about from locals. I made a label call &#8216;add Riprap&#8217; at the northernmost point of the pink line that represents our trail because the trail isn&#8217;t on caltopo&#8217;s platform. I was able to find it on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hiking Project (opens in a new tab)" href="http://hikingproject.com" target="_blank">Hiking Project</a> and embedded it below, where you can see routing and terrain information.</p>

Most things are in the right place</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the image above, you can see where some of the markers are placed. The one labeled &#8216;No-Pack Peak&#8217; begins at that point and ends two miles later when we got back to our packs. The high point we hiked to packless was Turk Mountain. The label &#8216;Night 1 Campsite&#8217; is unfortunately place at the second time we pass that location. It should be located at the 10.3 mile mark.</p>

Gallery and a few more details after the writeup.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>My Favorite Book: A Writeup</h4>



<p>My favorite book at the moment is The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear by Patrick Rothfuss.  It&#8217;s the second book of his yet-to-be-completed trilogy, The Kingkiller Chronicle. The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear barely edges out its predecessor, The Name of the Wind, as my favorite novel. Some of the complaints I&#8217;ve heard about these books are well founded. The plot meanders. The narrator is unreliable. The protagonist is too good at everything, and his love interest is the worst. True, true, and true! BUT&#8230;</p>



<p>The plot meandering is something I love. Rothfuss puts stories in his stories. It&#8217;s not often I pick up one book and I get 10+ stories for the cost of admission. The narrator being unreliable makes me think twice and second guess everything that he says. The narration, a reminiscence by the protagonist Kvothe, is framed in such a way that he has no incentive to be truthful. He is admittedly a liar and is occasionally demonstrably so in his recounting of the story. Rothfuss hasn&#8217;t taken excessive advantage of this, but uses it brilliantly to make unexpected changes that contradict what the reader expected without building resentment for an intentional deceit. As for the protagonist being too good at everything and his love interest being a terrible character, there is no redemption. I don&#8217;t like either character, actually, but even that doesn&#8217;t detract from my enjoyment of the writing and the world that the books take place in.</p>



<p>What do I love about it? The prose and world-building. While many stories are narratively driven or character driven, this novel is built around how beautifully Rothfuss can write and create a world. He plays with the English language in a masterful way that I&#8217;ve never seen equaled. His plays on words, dualities of meaning, and hints so subtle that I didn&#8217;t recognize them for what they were until I read the book 10 times and had it explained to me twice. And I&#8217;m sure more of those will crawl out of woodwork and show their sneaky selves once book three is ready. His world building assumes an intelligent reader who can connect the dots and understand a complexity that clearly exists in Rothfuss&#8217;s imagination and he translates beautifully into text without encumbering the reader with excessive details.  His magic system is novel, and its functioning fairly explicit. But for me, Rothfuss leaves enough to the reader&#8217;s imagination to not ruin immersion through clear departure from reason or the laws of the universe in which we live. He even makes an effort to incorporate some of those in a way that absolutely works for me. He builds his world through the stories that he weaves in around the main plot, and through subtleties of character interaction, and it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>



<p>I highly recommend this book to fans of the fantasy genre, or anybody whose eye was caught by my description. I hope somebody who reads this finds Patrick Rothfuss&#8217;s Kingkiller Chronicle as enjoyable as I do.<br></p>



<h4>The Book Binding Project!</h4>



<p>I absolutely love working with my hands. A few years ago, I had an idea that my dad and I could work on a project together: binding books in leather. Me for my girlfriend, and him for my stepmom. I chose The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear not realizing that my girlfriend preferred Rothfuss&#8217;s previous book, The Name of the Wind. This was our first foray into book binding, but I did some research into what materials I would need, I mapped out some layouts on a book, and I created a shopping list. I needed: a paperback copy of the book, a big enough piece of scrap leather, some nail sets of various sizes for engraving, a set of 6mm letter stamps, elmer&#8217;s glue, and some wrapping paper for the inner lining. </p>



<p>I got a paperback copy of the book because it&#8217;s cheaper, usually smaller, and the cover has to be torn off anyways to replace it with leather. For leather I got an unfinished single shoulder in 6-7oz weight after checking the size of the paperback copy and calculating the overhang I wanted for the cover. Elmer&#8217;s glue is polyvinyl acetate, the same as common bookbinding adhesive. And for the wrapping paper I decided on an old-fashioned, stylized map. I used an old cereal box cut to the calculated size as a template over which to glue, cut and fold the leather. I had to cut away some material  from the inside of the folds in order to get everything to work decently.</p>



<p>For the designs, I decided on some imagery that was memorable and important to the story that I thought I was capable of tackling. In a format like this where I didn&#8217;t have much control over texture or color, I decided to go with the Cthaeh&#8217;s tree and the Selas flowers. I wish I had taken more pictures during the process as I cut, folded, glued, and dried at each stage. Check out the pictures I do have in the album below!</p>



<iframe src="https://albumizr.com/a/GyEJ" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" width="700" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p>I was extremely happy with the result of my first attempt at leatherworking and book binding! The result is far from perfect, but it made a great and memorable gift, and it was an awesome excuse to spend time with my dad working on it.</p>



<p>If you have any questions about how to get started or which resources I used, or if you have suggestions for how to improve next time, please reach out to to me by email at <a href="mailto:feedback@thebrandofben.com">feedback@thebrandofben.com</a> or use the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="contact form (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact form</a> on the website.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[From the serious verticality of climbing Mt LeConte, to a chill (pun intended) hike up to Rainbow Falls, and conquering Old Settlers Trail in an afternoon. This was a weekend to remember.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="#Day1">Day 1 &#8211; Mt LeConte via Alum Cave Bluffs</a><br><a href="#Day2">Day 2 &#8211; Rainbow Falls</a><br><a href="#Day3">Day 3 &#8211; Old Settlers Trail</a></p>



<p>To celebrate the beginning of spring, my birthday, and just as an excuse to see friends that live too far apart, we decided to go on a weekend trip to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We got an awesome little cabin up in the mountains about a ten minute drive from the downtown area. Over the next few days we ate delicious food, enjoyed great company, and explored a bit of the beautiful Great Smokey Mountains National Park.</p>



<h3 id="Day1">Day 1 &#8211; Saturday, March 30th &#8211; Mt LeConte via Alum Cave Bluffs</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000-1024x238.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-756" width="1024" height="238" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000.jpg 1024w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000-300x70.jpg 300w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000-768x179.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Panorama of all four of us atop Mount LeConte&#8217;s Myrtle Point!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Morgan, Cece, Danny and I parked at the Alum Cave Bluffs Trailhead just after 9am to hike probably the most popular mountain in the area: Mount LeConte. The weather looked absolutely perfect for a hike, with the high down in the valley forecast in the mid-70s. Saturdays are a busy day on popular routes like this, but we found parking and got started with no trouble at all. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-760" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Arch Rock, about 1 mile in</figcaption></figure>



<p>I didn&#8217;t take many pictures on the way up, but I managed to snap a few before the burn set in and the smiles started to fade. Arch Rock is the first cool landmark that we saw, as pictured above, and you climb right through this very unique formation. The next notable photo op we passed was the Alum Cave Bluffs themselves. I thought it was so neat to be able to look straight up and see trees growing directly above me, and some melt from the higher elevations was dripping down and getting carried in interesting patterns by the crazy wind currents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-763" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption>Are they just taking a break, or rethinking the rest of the elevation gain?</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Alum Cave Bluffs are just under 2.5 miles in. They&#8217;re a perfect turnaround point if you haven&#8217;t sweated out enough Gatlinburg moonshine to climb another 1600&#8242; of elevation. I didn&#8217;t take many pictures on the way up the mountain, but a few times we would climb around a bend or through a gap in the trees and I would have to stop to snap a few. No need to upload those, though. As is often the case on hikes I took the pictures not knowing that the view from the top blew them out of the water.<br></p>

<p>We reached the summit at 11:40, so it took us about two and a half hours to get to the top. I&#8217;m so glad we went the extra 3/4 miles to Myrtle Point. Almost no elevation change, but a lot fewer hikers, a very cool trail as you approach the point, and incredible views. We munched on some ham &amp; cheese sandwiches and coconut and cashew snacks from Costco before heading back down the mountain. </p>

<p>We hopped in our cabin&#8217;s hot tub with some beers to recover from the hike. Later we headed into town for some eats and Gatlinburg moonshine.</p>

<h3 id="Day2">Day 2 &#8211; Sunday, March 31st &#8211; Rainbow Falls Hike</h3>

Up at the falls where the snow is sticking. Is there a better way to spend a day?</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, Cece and Danny couldn&#8217;t stick around for another day. We spent the morning with them wandering around downtown before setting off for our afternoon hike. We decided to hike a different face of Mt LeConte up to a waterfall called Rainbow Falls. The weather was a bit chillier but that has never stopped me from enjoying a hike before! Just got to have the right gear.</p>

<h3 id="Day3">Day 3 &#8211; Monday, April 1st &#8211; Old Settler&#8217;s Trail</h3>

This was within a mile of the end and we were spent!</figcaption></figure>



<p>We started this 17.2 mile doozy from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Maddron Bald Trailhead (opens in a new tab)" href="https://goo.gl/maps/UgJ595rWjUEB9cZf9" target="_blank">Maddron Bald Trailhead</a> a little ways out of town after dropping one car off at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HkXt8KDFw1Ndf6Mf6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Grapeyard Ridge Trailhead</a>. We weren&#8217;t totally sure how long the hike was going to be, as different sources quoted different hike lengths. We got a late start, hiking from Maddron Bald Trailhead at 1230 pm and Morgan was stressing that we wouldn&#8217;t make it while it was still light out. When we got to the first trail marker it showed that the total mileage would be 17.2 total and that ended up being dead on according to our phones.</p>



<iframe src="https://albumizr.com/a/-ZIU" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" width="700" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p>I didn&#8217;t take as many pictures on this one. There&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a great write-up on the Great Smoky Mountains National Park website (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gsmnp.com/old-settlers-trail/" target="_blank">a great write-up on the Great Smoky Mountains National Park website</a>! To me it was a great balance between well-maintained and slightly overgrown. Bridges were functional but I felt like getting out of town much more than the very busy Mt LeConte trails.</p>



<p>Overall, Gatlinburg was a great experience and the weather and views from the top of Mt LeConte were the most stunning I&#8217;ve seen in the US. The infrastructure is well developed and there are hike options for those of most skill levels to get up to the top of the mountain!</p>

<p>On March 15th, I met up with my friend Pat halfway between Charlottesville and NoVa for a hike.  The forecast called for clear, sunny skies with a high of 70 down in the valley. Just about perfect hiking weather! We decided to meet up at Thornton Gap because of the similar drive times for each of us, but we didn&#8217;t really have a hike in mind.  I had a preference to start down at the bottom of the gap to avoid paying the entry fee onto Skyline Drive, but other than that I figured we would plan it when we arrived. I didn&#8217;t realize that we would have no signal and my offline maps didn&#8217;t include that region! I thought I remembered seeing trails that led to the ridge-line north and south of Route 211, so I knew that we should be able to make a loop of things. I also had the idea in mind that we should try to make it to Mary&#8217;s Rock, as that is supposed to have phenomenal views of the area.</p>

<p>We met up at the lower parking lot, farther east on 211. We left my car there and drove up to the next parking lot in Pat&#8217;s. We set off across the road and up Pass Mountain Trail, with occasional views across the gap of our beautiful and somewhat intimidating goal for the day: Mary&#8217;s Rock. We enjoyed great trail conditions and a steady reasonable climb for 2.7 miles until we reached the Pass Mountain Hut. Another 0.2 miles got us to the Appalachian Trail, where we turned left to go southbound. The trail took us down into Thornton Gap where we had two low-traffic road crossings and a view of Mary&#8217;s Rock shooting up above us.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-942x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-942x1024.jpg 942w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-276x300.jpg 276w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-768x835.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-1600x1740.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" /><figcaption>Mary&#8217;s Rock from Thornton Gap</figcaption></figure>



<p>From there it was a serious (and seriously fun) climb up the mountain. We passed a family with a little guy, 10ish, who looked ready to quit, and another couple wearing jeans who I felt even worse for. There were a couple icy sections next to drop offs that I wasn&#8217;t expecting to find after the recent weather, but nothing else of note on the way up. Once to the top there&#8217;s a beautiful vista, but it looked like we could get even higher by scrambling up some of the rocks so we stopped for long enough to throw on windbreakers and started climbing. Atop the highest of these, we found a little USGS marker letting us know we had reached the summit! This was Pat&#8217;s first peak achieved in the U.S. and what an incredible day for it.</p>

<p>We spent 30-35 minutes at the top loving life, chatting, and eating snacks. There&#8217;s nowhere I would rather spend a beautiful Friday than hiking with good friends and relaxing on top of mountains. That&#8217;s the dream. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, we eventually had to start heading down from there. We thought we heard people passing by on the trail just behind the peak, so instead of backtracking, we bushwhacked down to the trail. We turned at the next intersection we saw, hoping it was the right place, and followed Meadow Spring Trail down to Skyline Drive. This part of the hike was uneventful, with a few valley views but nothing that compared to the view from the top. We crossed Skyline and proceeded down Buck Hollow Trail to my car, paralleling and occasionally crossing the stream that ran through the hollow.</p>



<p>Overall, the hike was amazing as a day hike for many reasons: it&#8217;s a perfect distance from each of us, the trail was nice, packed dirt for the vast majority, the views from the top were amazing, the distance was just right, and we were able to make the hike a loop. Overall, it was an absolute stunner.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[This is a brief description of how I got my website up and running! From no formal programming experience to creating and administrating my own website. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>My First Post</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m so excited to finally have my own website and brand! The first step towards big things to come. This is just a brief description of what the last couple days have involved with getting a website set up. I&#8217;ll try to explain how I made some of my decisions, what resources worked and which didn&#8217;t, and maybe somebody can benefit from my experience!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190306_183147-e1551916601105-576x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48"/><figcaption>I started it all right from here!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Buying a Domain Name</h3>



<p>I spent all of five minutes deciding on a company name. Having very little notion of what direction this little brand is going, I just decided to make it generic. Fortunately, nobody was sitting on this name. I did trademark and copyright searches, confirmed that nobody was using it on gmail, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, and nobody was using the coveted &#8216;.com&#8217; domain name. I established placeholder accounts on social media sites and then started looking into how to buy a domain name. A couple different services came to the forefront after my research: GoDaddy, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://domains.google.com" target="_blank">Google Domains</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, and the service I ended up using: <a href="http://namecheap.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">NameCheap.</a> They all provide extremely similar services as far as purchasing domains; the differences arise from how easily you&#8217;re able to integrate site hosting and email hosting, and maybe some other features that matter even less to me. NameCheap was the least expensive and had all the features I needed. Ten dollars and a few minutes later I became the proud owner of www.thebrandofben.com for a year.</p>



<h3>Hosting the Website</h3>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, Amazon&#8217;s native service, Google&#8217;s native service, self-hosting my website, or any of the hundreds of other hosts out there? I decided on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. Free hosting, reliable servers, easy to track and revert changes. What&#8217;s the trade-off? It&#8217;s a static site host, so I can&#8217;t use many powerful server tools that come alongside a database focused content management system (CMS). I also won&#8217;t be able to use the wildly popular <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress </a>or <a href="http://squarespace.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SquareSpace </a>with their highly developed user interfaces, user and browser experiences, and extensive customization options. But, by opting for the static site, I have fewer security vulnerabilities, faster browsing speed, and low upkeep. Github Pages also made it very easy to set up routing for my domain and has HTTPS/SSL support integrated free of cost.</p>



<h3>Mail Hosting</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s very cool (and very professional) to have an email address at your own site, like <a href="mailto:bshort@thebrandofben.com">bshort@thebrandofben.com</a>. But what if I want to be able to send from <a href="mailto:newsletter@thebrandofben.com">newsletter@thebrandofben.com</a>? Or I want to get opinions by receiving at <a href="mailto:feedback@thebrandofben.com">feedback@thebrandofben.com</a>? From my admittedly limited research, it appeared that companies charge $2.50-$4.00 per month per account. I don&#8217;t expect to be using &#8216;contact&#8217; or &#8216;info&#8217; or &#8216;support&#8217; often enough for that to make sense, but I&#8217;d like to have those options available to send or receive from. </p>



<p>The reason my research wasn&#8217;t extensive is because I quickly found that Zoho has a mail hosting service. I&#8217;ve used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://sheets.zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho Sheets</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://projects.zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho Projects</a> as part of the Zoho office suite and been blown away by the functionality of their offerings. As soon as I saw that <a href="http://mail.zoho.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Zoho Mail</a> had a free mail hosting option, I pulled the trigger. And I&#8217;m glad I did! They made the fairly technical process of setting up mail routing very easy, and they allowed me to make various aliases to send and receive emails. They also support 2-factor authentication and the mail service is well integrated with the rest of their office suite. Can&#8217;t say enough good things about my experience with Zoho.</p>



<h3>Making a Website!</h3>



<p>This is where I ran into trouble. I don&#8217;t know anything about graphic design or anything but the most rudimentary HTML and CSS. My JavaScript skills are laughable at best! But Github Pages is affiliated with a program called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Jekyll</a>, and they tout it as being able to set up in no time! </p>



<h5>The Static Site Generator Dead Ends</h5>



<p>Uh oh. Turns out it uses Ruby. I haven&#8217;t seen a glimpse of this programming language before. I decided to download it, give it a try, and see if I can get something workable going while learning on the fly. It was quickly clear that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have a serviceable site deployed in, well, the amount of time I was willing to spend to get one started. What else do people use?</p>



<p><a href="http://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Hugo </a>seemed to drum up a lot of enthusiasm online. Looking at their showcase, I was very impressed by what people were able to do with a static HTML site. But as I looked for alternatives, I found an option I thought would suit my needs even better. </p>



<h5>WordPress to Generate a Static Site</h5>



<p>Some absolute saints have developed plugins for WordPress that allow you to create a website, then convert it to static HTML pages, and host those however you see fit. After a botched attempt at local hosting using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://apachefriends.org" target="_blank">XAMPP</a>, I was able to get a local hosting environment set up using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">WAMP</a>. This allows me to test and develop the database-driven WordPress site on my own computer, then deploy a static version to Github Pages. This option severely diminishes the features available, but allows enough customization and aesthetic optimization to suit my needs perfectly well.</p>



<h3>And finally!</h3>



<p>The finished product is what you&#8217;re currently browsing! </p>



<p>I have big dreams and high hopes for this little website and brand new company. I can&#8217;t wait to share more of my projects and develop my brand with the skill-set and values that are important to me.  <br>I hope that the information here interests or helps somebody and I hope you stay in touch to see what&#8217;s next for the Brand of Ben! </p>
