<p>On March 15th, I met up with my friend Pat halfway between Charlottesville and NoVa for a hike.  The forecast called for clear, sunny skies with a high of 70 down in the valley. Just about perfect hiking weather! We decided to meet up at Thornton Gap because of the similar drive times for each of us, but we didn&#8217;t really have a hike in mind.  I had a preference to start down at the bottom of the gap to avoid paying the entry fee onto Skyline Drive, but other than that I figured we would plan it when we arrived. I didn&#8217;t realize that we would have no signal and my offline maps didn&#8217;t include that region! I thought I remembered seeing trails that led to the ridge-line north and south of Route 211, so I knew that we should be able to make a loop of things. I also had the idea in mind that we should try to make it to Mary&#8217;s Rock, as that is supposed to have phenomenal views of the area.</p>

<p>We met up at the lower parking lot, farther east on 211. We left my car there and drove up to the next parking lot in Pat&#8217;s. We set off across the road and up Pass Mountain Trail, with occasional views across the gap of our beautiful and somewhat intimidating goal for the day: Mary&#8217;s Rock. We enjoyed great trail conditions and a steady reasonable climb for 2.7 miles until we reached the Pass Mountain Hut. Another 0.2 miles got us to the Appalachian Trail, where we turned left to go southbound. The trail took us down into Thornton Gap where we had two low-traffic road crossings and a view of Mary&#8217;s Rock shooting up above us.</p>

<p>From there it was a serious (and seriously fun) climb up the mountain. We passed a family with a little guy, 10ish, who looked ready to quit, and another couple wearing jeans who I felt even worse for. There were a couple icy sections next to drop offs that I wasn&#8217;t expecting to find after the recent weather, but nothing else of note on the way up. Once to the top there&#8217;s a beautiful vista, but it looked like we could get even higher by scrambling up some of the rocks so we stopped for long enough to throw on windbreakers and started climbing. Atop the highest of these, we found a little USGS marker letting us know we had reached the summit! This was Pat&#8217;s first peak achieved in the U.S. and what an incredible day for it.</p>

<p>We spent 30-35 minutes at the top loving life, chatting, and eating snacks. There&#8217;s nowhere I would rather spend a beautiful Friday than hiking with good friends and relaxing on top of mountains. That&#8217;s the dream. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, we eventually had to start heading down from there. We thought we heard people passing by on the trail just behind the peak, so instead of backtracking, we bushwhacked down to the trail. We turned at the next intersection we saw, hoping it was the right place, and followed Meadow Spring Trail down to Skyline Drive. This part of the hike was uneventful, with a few valley views but nothing that compared to the view from the top. We crossed Skyline and proceeded down Buck Hollow Trail to my car, paralleling and occasionally crossing the stream that ran through the hollow.</p>



<p>Overall, the hike was amazing as a day hike for many reasons: it&#8217;s a perfect distance from each of us, the trail was nice, packed dirt for the vast majority, the views from the top were amazing, the distance was just right, and we were able to make the hike a loop. Overall, it was an absolute stunner.</p>



<p>Let me know what you found interesting, if there are any other similar hikes you&#8217;d recommend, or things in the area I might have missed! Thanks for reading.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[This is a brief description of how I got my website up and running! From no formal programming experience to creating and administrating my own website. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>My First Post</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m so excited to finally have my own website and brand! The first step towards big things to come. This is just a brief description of what the last couple days have involved with getting a website set up. I&#8217;ll try to explain how I made some of my decisions, what resources worked and which didn&#8217;t, and maybe somebody can benefit from my experience!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190306_183147-e1551916601105-576x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48"/><figcaption>I started it all right from here!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Buying a Domain Name</h3>



<p>I spent all of five minutes deciding on a company name. Having very little notion of what direction this little brand is going, I just decided to make it generic. Fortunately, nobody was sitting on this name. I did trademark and copyright searches, confirmed that nobody was using it on gmail, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, and nobody was using the coveted &#8216;.com&#8217; domain name. I established placeholder accounts on social media sites and then started looking into how to buy a domain name. A couple different services came to the forefront after my research: GoDaddy, <a href="http://domains.google.com">Google Domains</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, and the service I ended up using: <a href="http://namecheap.com">NameCheap.</a> They all provide extremely similar services as far as purchasing domains; the differences arise from how easily you&#8217;re able to integrate site hosting and email hosting, and maybe some other features that matter even less to me. NameCheap was the least expensive and had all the features I needed. Ten dollars and a few minutes later I became the proud owner of www.thebrandofben.com for a year.</p>



<h3>Hosting the Website</h3>



<p><a href="http://netlify.com">Netlify</a>, Amazon&#8217;s native service, Google&#8217;s native service, self-hosting my website, or any of the hundreds of other hosts out there? I decided on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. Free hosting, reliable servers, easy to track and revert changes. What&#8217;s the trade-off? It&#8217;s a static site host, so I can&#8217;t use many powerful server tools that come alongside a database focused content management system (CMS). I also won&#8217;t be able to use the wildly popular <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress </a>or <a href="http://squarespace.com">SquareSpace </a>with their highly developed user interfaces, user and browser experiences, and extensive customization options. But, by opting for the static site, I have fewer security vulnerabilities, faster browsing speed, and low upkeep. Github Pages also made it very easy to set up routing for my domain and has HTTPS/SSL support integrated free of cost.</p>



<h3>Mail Hosting</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s very cool (and very professional) to have an email address at your own site, like <a href="mailto:bshort@thebrandofben.com">bshort@thebrandofben.com</a>. But what if I want to be able to send from <a href="mailto:newsletter@thebrandofben.com">newsletter@thebrandofben.com</a>? Or I want to get opinions by receiving at <a href="mailto:feedback@thebrandofben.com">feedback@thebrandofben.com</a>? From my admittedly limited research, it appeared that companies charge $2.50-$4.00 per month per account. I don&#8217;t expect to be using &#8216;contact&#8217; or &#8216;info&#8217; or &#8216;support&#8217; often enough for that to make sense, but I&#8217;d like to have those options available to send or receive from. </p>



<p>The reason my research wasn&#8217;t extensive is because I quickly found that Zoho has a mail hosting service. I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://sheets.zoho.com">Zoho Sheets</a> and <a href="http://projects.zoho.com">Zoho Projects</a> as part of the Zoho office suite and been blown away by the functionality of their offerings. As soon as I saw that <a href="http://mail.zoho.com">Zoho Mail</a> had a free mail hosting option, I pulled the trigger. And I&#8217;m glad I did! They made the fairly technical process of setting up mail routing very easy, and they allowed me to make various aliases to send and receive emails. They also support 2-factor authentication and the mail service is well integrated with the rest of their office suite. Can&#8217;t say enough good things about my experience with Zoho.</p>



<h3>Making a Website!</h3>



<p>This is where I ran into trouble. I don&#8217;t know anything about graphic design or anything but the most rudimentary HTML and CSS. My JavaScript skills are laughable at best! But Github Pages is affiliated with a program called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, and they tout it as being able to set up in no time! </p>



<h5>The Static Site Generator Dead Ends</h5>



<p>Uh oh. Turns out it uses Ruby. I haven&#8217;t seen a glimpse of this programming language before. I decided to download it, give it a try, and see if I can get something workable going while learning on the fly. It was quickly clear that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have a serviceable site deployed in, well, the amount of time I was willing to spend to get one started. What else do people use?</p>



<p><a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo </a>seemed to drum up a lot of enthusiasm online. Looking at their showcase, I was very impressed by what people were able to do with a static HTML site. But as I looked for alternatives, I found an option I thought would suit my needs even better. </p>



<h5>WordPress to Generate a Static Site</h5>



<p>Some absolute saints have developed plugins for WordPress that allow you to create a website, then convert it to static HTML pages, and host those however you see fit. After a botched attempt at local hosting using <a href="http://apachefriends.org">XAMPP</a>, I was able to get a local hosting environment set up using <a href="http://wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a>. This allows me to test and develop the WordPress, database-driven site on my own computer, then deploy a static version to Github Pages. This option severely diminishes the features available, but allows enough customization and aesthetic optimization to suit my needs perfectly well.</p>



<h3>And finally!</h3>



<p>The finished product is what you&#8217;re currently browsing! </p>



<p>I have big dreams and high hopes for this little website and brand new company. I can&#8217;t wait to share more of my projects and develop my brand with the skill-set and values that are important to me.  <br>I hope that the information here interests or helps somebody and I hope you stay in touch to see what&#8217;s next for the Brand of Ben! </p>
