<h4 style="text-align:center" id="intro">Intro</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zzPihtF.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zzPihtF.jpg" alt="This recipe results in easy, crusty, delicious, gourmet quality bread that you can make right at home. Check out how me and my starter, Danny Doughvito, team up to make a perfect loaf."/></a></figure>



<p><br> Final product first! This recipe I&#8217;ve adapted is very forgiving, fairly  hands-off for this style, and it has only four ingredients &#8211; flour,  water, salt, and starter (basically yeast). And more importantly it&#8217;s  DELICIOUS and disappears from the kitchen real quick. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qrcJRgz.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qrcJRgz.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>
Almost everything you need for this recipe right here! Four things I use
 that aren&#8217;t in this pic &#8211; a chopstick for mixing, and cornmeal to 
prevent sticking, a clean dish towel, and a cast iron skillet. The 
plastic container is 8 cups or ~2 liters. You don&#8217;t need the bananas!

</p>



<h4 style="text-align:center" id="first">First Rise (&amp; Autolyse)</h4>



<p>This first step includes both the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="autolyse process (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2017/09/29/using-the-autolyse-method/" target="_blank">autolyse process</a> and the first rise of the dough. I like extending the autolyse process and combining it with the first rise because I find it makes the dough much easier to knead into shape and it reduces the hands-on time of the recipe. At room temp, I give this step 6-24 hours. Let&#8217;s start getting ingredients combined!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6yqnmVf.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6yqnmVf.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>This recipe is intended to make 750g of dough, which is the perfect size for me to make once or twice a week. First, add 150g of starter to a similarly sized container. 180g was a mistake! But, as I said, this recipe is very forgiving. I&#8217;ll go into more detail on my starter later! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7gS3Bfn.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7gS3Bfn.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>
Next, add 240g of tap water and mix a bit to get the starter dissolved.

</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pOfaOPD.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pOfaOPD.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>
Add 360g bread flour. The final hydration we&#8217;re targeting for the dough is ~70%. Bread flour works better than all-purpose flour because of its higher gluten content, which helps add structure to the bread.

</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ccjY3ak.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ccjY3ak.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Mix it all together! No need to get crazy with this, as it&#8217;ll all sit together and the ingredients will meld. I find a chopstick to be a great tool for getting this incorporated. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TIOrVko.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TIOrVko.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Cover it up and leave it somewhere. I just leave it about in my kitchen and let it rise slowly instead of trying to find a warm place, but not for any good reason. There&#8217;s a lot of flexibility with how long it can stay like this &#8211; between 6 and 24 hours is ideal. </p>



<h4 style="text-align:center" id="starter">Refeeding the Starter</h4>



<p>The starter is a colony of living organisms that are your sidekicks in the bread making process. Like anything alive, they need food and water. At room temperature, a starter should be fed about once a day. I just make it part of my morning routine while my coffee brews!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/HlScln1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HlScln1.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>While the first rise is happening is a perfect time to feed up the depleted starter! A starter is basically yeast and bacteria that feed on flour and produce carbon dioxide, which is what leavens the loaf, and lactic acid, which is what makes sourdough sour. By manipulating the conditions of the starter, such as temperature, frequency of feedings, and ratio of flour and water, you can control how sour the bread will be! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/jPzci5K.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jPzci5K.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>This is my starter, Danny Doughvito! I keep him in this relatively small repurposed molasses container, but it&#8217;s a perfect size for how often and how much I feed and use it. I leave it out at room temperature and feed it equal parts flour and water every day, about 20g of each. If you leave it refrigerated, you only need to feed it once a week. The only time I pour any off is when I make bread! So, if I add about 40g of material a day and use about 160g of starter to make a loaf, I make one every 3-4 days. </p>



<h4 style="text-align:center" id="second">Second Rise</h4>



<p>The reason the bread rises is because yeast is eating flour and producing carbon dioxide that gets trapped in bubbles inside the dough. When we knead the dough into a loaf shape, we completely deflate it, so it&#8217;ll need another chance to rise. This is what creates even air pockets throughout the inside of the bread that make it pretty and light.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/aZKnhYm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aZKnhYm.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>This is the dough the next morning, about 16 hours later. It grew to nearly fill the container! I&#8217;ve found leaving the dough alone during this step lets the gluten and flavor develop and DRASTICALLY shortens the kneading required. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/2x2Hbkm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2x2Hbkm.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Add the salt! I go with 2% salt by weight. 2% of 750g is 15g! Generic iodized salt doesn&#8217;t taste as good as some other options, but it&#8217;s cheap and it&#8217;s (duh) a good source of iodine! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AQzQiVY.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AQzQiVY.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Everything you need for the next step: kneading the dough and letting it rise again. I like my textured dish cloth because it gives my loaves a cool look on the outside. I let the dough rise in this 1.5 liter bowl because I&#8217;ve found that expansion and diameter are good points to proceed to the baking step! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/5BNnD3d.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5BNnD3d.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>First, corn meal sprinklage onto the towel. As the dough rises inside of this, you don&#8217;t want it to stick. It&#8217;ll be dumped out onto a 500 degree (F) skillet, and that&#8217;s not a time you want the dough to stick to the towel. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fdCw2Mz.jpg?1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fdCw2Mz.jpg?1" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Next, knead it until it forms a taught layer. No need to overdo this step, I&#8217;ve found. It should take about one minute. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/w6CdMmC.jpg?1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/w6CdMmC.jpg?1" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Next, get it turned taught side down onto the corn meal, and do your best to twist and tie the rest together so the vast majority is part of the same taught outer skin. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/B7Y6gn1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/B7Y6gn1.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Drop the dough into the bowl, sprinkle the top of the dough with more corn meal, then gently fold the towel over the dough and let it rise again. </p>



<h4 style="text-align:center" id="baking">Baking</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/RZQxxI9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RZQxxI9.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>IT&#8217;S READY! This is about seven hours later. This is the only stage where you need to be careful! Jiggling and jostling will begin to deflate the dough and may make the loaf too dense. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6WUQV8T.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6WUQV8T.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Preheat your oven to 500 degrees (F) with the cast iron skillet and another pan or sheet tray inside that is oven safe BUT you&#8217;re not worried about damaging. The second junk pan will be used to pour water into to create a steamy environment and help create a thick beautiful crust, but pouring water onto 500 degree metal causes thermal shock that can warp the metal. I use an old metal pan which had the handle detached and lost. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/77Cy0tO.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Pull out the hot cast iron skillet CAREFULLY and invert the bowl of dough into it. Pull the dish towel away and voila! You have dough sizzling and heating up in the skillet. Next you want to score the dough with a sharp knife. This helps the dough rise nicely and has a cool aesthetic effect. The knife needs to cut deeply enough to see some of the internal air pockets. You can score it in any number of patterns to add your own distinct style! I went with a simple X. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Z8RvCzQ.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z8RvCzQ.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Next, return the cast iron skillet to the oven, pour two to three cups of water into the other hot &#8216;junk&#8217; pan in the oven, turn the temperature down to 425 (F), and set a timer for 20 minutes. After the timer goes off, remove the pan with the remaining water, and set another 20 minute timer. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/czTGa7p.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/czTGa7p.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>
The bread is done! Almost. It&#8217;s still 425 degrees. Move it onto a cooling rack and drape it with a clean dish towel until it has cooled.

</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/wVc4vn2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wVc4vn2.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Pro tips &#8211; I like to leave a towel on the bread as it cools because it encourages the crust to more quickly become a chewy and delicious crust instead of hard and crunchy. Also, leave the oven mitt on the cast iron skillet so your roommates don&#8217;t burn themselves if they want to use the stove! </p>



<h4 style="text-align:center" id="crumb">Crumb</h4>



<p>This next picture is what bakers call the crumb. It&#8217;s a cross-section showing the air pockets and the thickness of the crust. Once I made a few loaves I developed an eye, and a great appreciation, for a nice crumb shot.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/EE25Raq.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EE25Raq.jpg" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>
Now you have bread that is perfect to eat by itself, and even better with butter or as any type of sandwich. I find it shines as a breakfast sandwich bread or to make a nice pb and honey sandwich.

</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/yUaSHYc.jpg?1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yUaSHYc.jpg?1" alt=""/></a></figure>



<h4 style="text-align:center" id="summary">Summary &amp; Gallery</h4>



<p>To summarize, this 4 ingredient loaf needs (1) to have the flour, water, and starter combined, which takes about 5 minutes. Six to 24 hours later, it  needs (2) to have the salt added, kneaded into shape, and set in a bowl for a second rise, again about 5 minutes. Finally, five to twelve hours later begins the (3) hour long cooking process: 20 minutes to preheat, 20 minutes to steam, and 20 more minutes to finish. The process is lengthy but the active engagement is pretty low! It&#8217;s not equipment heavy and it&#8217;s very worth it. </p>

<p>The best way to start the day. These things are good hot or cold and easy to eat on the go. They&#8217;re also cheap, easy to make, and with 19g fat, 40g carbs, and 39g protein, they certainly have enough calories to keep you going through the day. And did I mention they taste AMAZING?</p>



<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h4>



<ul><li>8 large tortillas</li><li>2 dozen large eggs</li><li>1.5 lbs bacon</li><li>2 cups shredded cheese</li><li>1/4 cup sriracha</li></ul>



<p>For a detailed breakdown on costs, nutrition, and the brands I use, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this spreadsheet (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.zoho.com/file/c3c6h9516ae803c2c4be19c225ee3a9846dc6" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a>. For me, these burritos came out at $1.72 a piece, with 19g fat, 40g carbs, and 39g of protein providing 515 calories. </p>



<h4 id="cooking">Cooking:<br></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snapchat-1887474283_optimized.jpg"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snapchat-1887474283_optimized-169x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1048" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snapchat-1887474283_optimized-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snapchat-1887474283_optimized-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snapchat-1887474283_optimized-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snapchat-1887474283_optimized.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>First, I slice up the bacon into half inch pieces. Then, I put it in a large skillet on medium heat and let it cook until a LOT of the fat renders and most of the moisture is gone. Unlike cooking strips of bacon to eat straight off the stove, these can end up being small and crispy and still bring a full flavor game to the burritos. This is a fairly hands off process and only needs to be occasionally stirred in order to encourage even cooking and prevent burning. It&#8217;s a great time to get started on other cooking or cleaning! Next, I drain the fat. Don&#8217;t pour your grease down the drain! Because bacon fat solidifies at room temp, it will do so in your pipes or city pipes and cause long-term damage. Instead, I pour the grease into a mug, let it solidify, then scrape the solids into my trash can. By weighing this mug before and after I add the bacon fat, I&#8217;m able to use this little calculator to more accurately measure the amount of fat I have in each burrito!</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190319_180858_optimized.jpg"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190319_180858_optimized-e1558449262397-576x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1054" width="144" height="256" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190319_180858_optimized-e1558449262397-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190319_180858_optimized-e1558449262397-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190319_180858_optimized-e1558449262397-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190319_180858_optimized-e1558449262397-1600x2844.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Next, I crack the eggs straight into the pan with the drained bacon. All 24 of them! After this, I break all the yolks and try to keep everything moving. I pay particular attention to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan and burns. After all the eggs have cooked and mixed with the bacon, I turn off the stove, add in the shredded cheese and sriracha and mix everything together while it&#8217;s still hot enough to melt.</p>



<p>After waiting for the mixture to cool, I portion it into eight sections in the pan, much like cutting a pizza. Each of these I scoop out onto a waiting tortilla, wrap it up burrito style, and store it. If I&#8217;m going to eat them on the go, I&#8217;ll wrap each one in aluminum foil. Otherwise, they keep perfectly well for the week in tupperware. </p>



<p>Now you&#8217;ve got yourself some delicious breakfast burritos!</p>

<h4 id="substitutions">Substitutions:</h4>



<p>Before any real substitutions, consider looking at some additions! By making or buying some guac on the side, you can mix it up through the week. Various types of salsa are also a great addition to a breakfast burrito. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend packing these inside the burrito, as it may sog the tortilla and guacamole will certainly lose its bright green color.</p>



<p>You can also add all sorts of veggies! I&#8217;m not sure if potatoes count as a healthy addition, but mixing in some home fries or hash browns would be delicious and cheap. You could mix in raw spinach, bell peppers of any color, onions cooked or raw, black or pinto beans, or get some delicious brightness and color with cilantro.</p>



<p>Now on to the real substitutions! </p>



<p>The easiest one is substituting bacon for another protein, like sausage or ham. You can also use a lot less bacon and get a great burrito, but I prioritize more bacon over just about anything, including saving money or my personal health. The only substitution I won&#8217;t endorse is turkey bacon.</p>



<p>Another easy substitution is swapping out the tortilla for another edible food container. Pitas can be a great option, as can other forms of wraps that boast high fiber or low calorie counts. One option I haven&#8217;t tried but I&#8217;ve heard good things about are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="these homemade plantain tortillas (opens in a new tab)" href="https://minimalistbaker.com/3-ingredient-plantain-tortillas/" target="_blank">these homemade plantain tortillas</a>.</p>
