<h4>Intro</h4>



<p>For Valentine&#8217;s Day last year, I made my girlfriend a Raspberry Pi Magic Mirror! I love working with my hands, programming, and learning by trying something outside my comfort zone. And, of course, I love my girlfriend and (somewhat) practical gifts!</p>



<p>I&#8217;d heard about the Raspberry Pi previously and various projects that can be done with it. The Raspberry Pi is a very cool, small, and reasonably priced computer. It has more features than I really need, like extra USB ports, lots of GPIO pins, and an audio jack. The features I do need, included in the Raspberry Pi 3 model B, were 2 USB ports, wifi, and an HDMI port. Other awesome features are: the memory can be just a micro-SD chip, and power is supplied via micro-USB.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/raspberrypiscale_optimized.jpg"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/raspberrypiscale_optimized.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1025" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/raspberrypiscale_optimized.jpg 890w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/raspberrypiscale_optimized-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/raspberrypiscale_optimized-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" /></a><figcaption>To give a sense of scale. This is an entire computer!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One Raspberry Pi project that stood out was the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Magic Mirror (opens in a new tab)" href="https://magicmirror.builders/" target="_blank">Magic Mirror</a>. At its core, this is just a computer behind a one way mirror, so that it functions as a mirror but any illuminated text, videos, or pictures on the screen show through the one way mirror.</p>



<h4 id="design">Design</h4>



<p>Next, I had to design it. I decided to go with a 23&#8243; or 24&#8243; monitor because <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="one of the best, cheapest one-way mirror options (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2EiZisy" target="_blank">one of the best, cheapest one-way mirror options</a> matched up well with that size monitor without much trimming. I figured I would go with a wood frame, which I estimated would need to be 6&#8243; deep to accommodate all the electronics. I decided to use aluminum drywall bead as a retaining lip in front to keep the monitor secure, and wooden dowels behind it. I decided to secure most of the internals with sticky Velcro strips. I wanted an LED light strip around the edge because I think they look very cool, and I also needed an extension cord that could power the monitor, RPi, and the lights. I partially drew this up, partially visualized it, and mostly hoped it would just come together in the end!</p>



<h4 id="shopping">Shopping</h4>



<p>So then I made a shopping list! </p>



<p>Computer: I needed a Raspberry Pi, an HDMI cable, a power supply, a microSD (32gb for flexibility), and a computer screen. I already had a heat sink, thermal paste, and USB mouse and keyboard. I bought the Raspberry Pi parts individually, but it looks like there is now <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a kit with these parts priced better in a bundle (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2VubxbG" target="_blank">a kit with these parts priced better in a bundle</a>. For the computer screen, I would recommend Craigslist for the best deals. Alternatively, eBay, Best Buy, and Walmart all sell refurbished monitors at better price points than buying new.</p>



<p>Tools: I needed a drill, and after some thorough research I decided on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this budget option (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2Hq2N2q" target="_blank">this budget option</a> which has held up well in the year since. I mostly went with hand tools otherwise, because my apartment doesn&#8217;t have a lot of storage or work space. I got a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="hand saw (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2JPt9wC" target="_blank">hand saw</a> for the wooden frame and a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="hacksaw  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2Q9VheH" target="_blank">hacksaw</a> for the aluminum LED strip frame (to be discussed later). I already had a measuring tape, wood glue, painters tape, and scissors. The painters tape and scissors are for cutting the one-way mirror. One other tool I had in my toolbox that ended up being indispensable was a metal file, which I used for scoring and smoothing the aluminum LED strip frame.</p>



<p>Materials: I had some wood screws floating around my toolbox and I had some sticky velcro strips that would allow me to secure electronics inside but remove and adjust or replace them easily if needed. I needed wood for the frame and ended up getting one piece of 6&#8243;x1&#8243; lumber to cut to size and paint. I got a few 1&#8243;x1&#8243; dowels to help secure the monitor in the frame. I got aluminum drywall bead to wrap around the front and keep the monitor and acrylic from falling out through the front of the frame. Finally, I needed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a secure wall-mounting bracket (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2Hq3JUn" target="_blank">a secure wall-mounting bracket</a>.</p>



<p>Aesthetics: There are very few parts visible after the project is completed. Just the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="one-way mirror (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2EiZisy" target="_blank">one-way mirror</a>, the outside of the frame, the LED light strip, and the power cord. I decided to go with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a remote control, multicolor, multifunction light strip (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2w8bRTk" target="_blank">a remote control, multicolor, multifunction light strip</a> once I found one that was long enough to wrap all the way around the border of my mirror. I also needed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="these aluminum channels (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2HofnPz" target="_blank">these aluminum channels</a> to house the LED strips with frosted plastic covers. For the power supply, I chose <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this one (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2HpLfDs" target="_blank">this one</a> that had a good looking woven fiber cord that was a decent length and had enough outlets for everything.</p>



<p>After getting a good deal on my monitor on Craigslist, and not counting my Lowe&#8217;s run because I don&#8217;t remember the cost, this came out to $245 and I had some new tools afterwards!</p>



<h4 id="assembly">Assembly</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20180213_184301_optimized.jpg"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20180213_184301_optimized-e1558189199854-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1027" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20180213_184301_optimized-e1558189199854-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20180213_184301_optimized-e1558189199854-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20180213_184301_optimized-e1558189199854-1600x2133.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption>Does my cable management make you anxious?</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Measure twice, cut once. The assembly was pretty straightforward! I won&#8217;t quote any specific numbers because I never saved them to my computer and I don&#8217;t remember them.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">The Frame</p>



<p>I sawed the wood to the right length, glued the faces that would be in contact, and screwed them together. I drilled three holes through the top along the center line to help with ventilation, and I drilled one hole in the center of the bottom and then sawed to each side of it for both ventilation and for the power cord. I calculated how long I would need each piece of aluminum frame to be and then I scored the aluminum with my file before sawing them at a 45 degree angle. I cut off an extra 1/4 of the section that connected at the corner where I wanted the LED light strip to come out from behind the frame. I screwed the drywall bead onto the front and secured it and the aluminum LED channels by driving screws through both. </p>



<p style="text-align:center">The Screen</p>



<p>The acrylic was the right width, but was too long. In order to cut it, I figured out where the cut would be, and then covered back and front along that line with painters tape. At that point I was able to cut along that line with scissors without damaging the acrylic! I removed the painters tape and was then able to put the acrylic in through the back and put the partially disassembled monitor on top. I took off parts of the monitor to decrease its profile and weight. As is visible in the picture above, I secured the monitor in place with dowels placed horizontally and held in place with glue, more dowel pieces, and glue.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">The Electronics</p>



<p>I plugged the monitor&#8217;s speakers and remote receiver back into the monitor and secured them at the top of the assembly. I fastened the Raspberry Pi towards the center of the monitor using velcro strips (that&#8217;s how I secured everything), and I put the power supply towards the bottom. In order to get the LED strip to run into the aluminum channel, I had to drill a hole in the corner behind where the frosted plastic would cover and conceal. The LED strip comes with peelaway adhesive backs that fit perfectly into the channels. After it was in place, I cut the frosted plastic covers down to size with scissors and popped them into place. Then it was just a matter of plugging everything in! The LED plugged straight into a USB port on the extension cord, an HDMI runs between the RPi and the monitor, and power cords run to both. Easy peasy.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Mounting</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="This video (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hangmanproducts.com/products/heavy-duty-mirror-picture-hanger?variant=258585436" target="_blank">This video</a>.</p>



<iframe src="https://albumizr.com/a/PZUS" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" width="700" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>



<p style="text-align:center">Raspberry Pi Setup</p>



<p>First, I had to put an operating system on the microSD that was functioning as the Raspberry Pi&#8217;s hard drive. After installing Raspbian, putting the microSD into the Raspberry Pi, I booted up with my mouse and keyboard attached for the first and last time. I set up wifi, VNC and SSH connections so that I could interact with the RPi graphically (VNC), but also quickly and nonintrusively (SSH). For most of the things I needed to do I would just need the command line interface that SSH offers, but because the end product of a Magic Mirror is very visually based, I needed to make sure that what I was doing was having the graphic effect I intended, hence VNC.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Magic Mirror Installation</p>



<p>This project is incredible. It makes it so easy to get started and even easy to get a great finished product, but it also makes it easy to get lost in programming and personalization. Which is dangerous for me! I followed the step-by-step instructions for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="installation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror#installation" target="_blank">installation</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="configuration (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/Configuring-the-Raspberry-Pi" target="_blank">configuration</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="auto-starting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/Auto-Starting-MagicMirror" target="_blank">auto-starting</a>. These steps mean that there is no screen saver, no mouse visible, and the Magic Mirror program doesn&#8217;t need to be manually restarted when the RPi is.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Magic Mirror Customization</p>



<p>The modular nature of the Magic Mirror project makes it a ton of fun, and very easy, to use and adapt contributions from other people. I heavily modified several of the native modules. I also added a lot of new entries to the compliments module and incorporated some cool iCals into the calendar module which I had modified. The iCals I added were the University of South Carolina&#8217;s football schedule, a new movie release schedule, a holiday schedule, and a live updated iCal incorporated into my Google calendar so I can add events in my Google account and they&#8217;ll show up on the mirror. </p>



<p>I added <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MMM-NetworkScanner (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ianperrin/MMM-NetworkScanner" target="_blank">MMM-NetworkScanner</a>, which displays when you or roommates have had your devices connect to the wifi. I programmed the additional feature for it to turn the screen off when nobody had been connected to the wifi for 15 minutes and back on when somebody returns.</p>



<p>I changed the weather app to one that I believe to be more accurate and also has cooler weather animations than the native app.</p>



<p>I installed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MMM-TelegramBot (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/eouia/MMM-TelegramBot" target="_blank">MMM-TelegramBot</a> to send notifications to my phone if the temperature or other specs went outside of range, and be able to manually shut off the mirror in that case.</p>



<p>I went through a lot of ideas and debugging and modules before deciding on a low clutter option that I really like. Top left is the calendar (no longer modified after one of the recent updates really polished it up!) including the iCals. The top right is the weather, showing the conditions and temperature forecast for the day in 3 hour increments and also the forecast for 3 days into the future. In the bottom of the screen I have the native compliments module with the modified compliment bank that I created. Right above the compliments I have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MMM-Carousel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/MMM-Carousel" target="_blank">MMM-Carousel</a> rotating one of the following at a time (1) the native news module with headlines from reputable sources, (2) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MMM-Dad-Jokes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/echang15/MMM-Dad-Jokes" target="_blank">MMM-Dad-Jokes</a> which is guaranteed to make you groan, (3) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MMM-History (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/cowboysdude/MMM-History" target="_blank">MMM-History</a> which shows an interesting fact or event from the current date in history, and (4) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MMM-Reddit (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kjb085/MMM-Reddit" target="_blank">MMM-Reddit</a> which shows the headlines and thumbnails from the top 3 trending Reddit posts at the time.</p>



<p>There are tons of other amazing modules that I suggested to my girlfriend but she didn&#8217;t think she would use. There are also tons of tools that could be useful on your mirror that haven&#8217;t been made into modules yet! There&#8217;s nothing I needed or thought of which I was unable to find in the 3rd party module repository.</p>



<h4 id="takeways">Takeaways</h4>



<p style="text-align:center">Recommendations</p>



<p>I think it would be amazing to use some of those GPIO pins or USBs for additional features. It&#8217;s not too late to modify mine I guess. If you&#8217;re considering building one, I&#8217;d say it would be cool to include a microphone to be able to give it voice commands. It would also be cool to have an IR transmitter and/or receiver. That way it could control any nearby TVs or the LED strip programmatically. Or, with both a mic and IR features, it could control the TV and LED strips by voice command.</p>



<p style="text-align:center">Success!</p>



<p>This was everything I hoped it would be. Educational, fun, useful, memorable, and appreciated. There are lots of ways to show somebody you love them, and I think this got the message across.</p>



<p>I love you, Morgan! Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day 2018 again!</p>

Gallery and a few more details after the writeup.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>My Favorite Book: A Writeup</h4>



<p>My favorite book at the moment is The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear by Patrick Rothfuss.  It&#8217;s the second book of his yet-to-be-completed trilogy, The Kingkiller Chronicle. The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear barely edges out its predecessor, The Name of the Wind, as my favorite novel. Some of the complaints I&#8217;ve heard about these books are well founded. The plot meanders. The narrator is unreliable. The protagonist is too good at everything, and his love interest is the worst. True, true, and true! BUT&#8230;</p>



<p>The plot meandering is something I love. Rothfuss puts stories in his stories. It&#8217;s not often I pick up one book and I get 10+ stories for the cost of admission. The narrator being unreliable makes me think twice and second guess everything that he says. The narration, a reminiscence by the protagonist Kvothe, is framed in such a way that he has no incentive to be truthful. He is admittedly a liar and is occasionally demonstrably so in his recounting of the story. Rothfuss hasn&#8217;t taken excessive advantage of this, but uses it brilliantly to make unexpected changes that contradict what the reader expected without building resentment for an intentional deceit. As for the protagonist being too good at everything and his love interest being a terrible character, there is no redemption. I don&#8217;t like either character, actually, but even that doesn&#8217;t detract from my enjoyment of the writing and the world that the books take place in.</p>



<p>What do I love about it? The prose and world-building. While many stories are narratively driven or character driven, this novel is built around how beautifully Rothfuss can write and create a world. He plays with the English language in a masterful way that I&#8217;ve never seen equaled. His plays on words, dualities of meaning, and hints so subtle that I didn&#8217;t recognize them for what they were until I read the book 10 times and had it explained to me twice. And I&#8217;m sure more of those will crawl out of woodwork and show their sneaky selves once book three is ready. His world building assumes an intelligent reader who can connect the dots and understand a complexity that clearly exists in Rothfuss&#8217;s imagination and he translates beautifully into text without encumbering the reader with excessive details.  His magic system is novel, and its functioning fairly explicit. But for me, Rothfuss leaves enough to the reader&#8217;s imagination to not ruin immersion through clear departure from reason or the laws of the universe in which we live. He even makes an effort to incorporate some of those in a way that absolutely works for me. He builds his world through the stories that he weaves in around the main plot, and through subtleties of character interaction, and it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>



<p>I highly recommend this book to fans of the fantasy genre, or anybody whose eye was caught by my description. I hope somebody who reads this finds Patrick Rothfuss&#8217;s Kingkiller Chronicle as enjoyable as I do.<br></p>



<h4>The Book Binding Project!</h4>



<p>I absolutely love working with my hands. A few years ago, I had an idea that my dad and I could work on a project together: binding books in leather. Me for my girlfriend, and him for my stepmom. I chose The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear not realizing that my girlfriend preferred Rothfuss&#8217;s previous book, The Name of the Wind. This was our first foray into book binding, but I did some research into what materials I would need, I mapped out some layouts on a book, and I created a shopping list. I needed: a paperback copy of the book, a big enough piece of scrap leather, some nail sets of various sizes for engraving, a set of 6mm letter stamps, elmer&#8217;s glue, and some wrapping paper for the inner lining. </p>



<p>I got a paperback copy of the book because it&#8217;s cheaper, usually smaller, and the cover has to be torn off anyways to replace it with leather. For leather I got an unfinished single shoulder in 6-7oz weight after checking the size of the paperback copy and calculating the overhang I wanted for the cover. Elmer&#8217;s glue is polyvinyl acetate, the same as common bookbinding adhesive. And for the wrapping paper I decided on an old-fashioned, stylized map. I used an old cereal box cut to the calculated size as a template over which to glue, cut and fold the leather. I had to cut away some material  from the inside of the folds in order to get everything to work decently.</p>



<p>For the designs, I decided on some imagery that was memorable and important to the story that I thought I was capable of tackling. In a format like this where I didn&#8217;t have much control over texture or color, I decided to go with the Cthaeh&#8217;s tree and the Selas flowers. I wish I had taken more pictures during the process as I cut, folded, glued, and dried at each stage. Check out the pictures I do have in the album below!</p>

<p>I was extremely happy with the result of my first attempt at leatherworking and book binding! The result is far from perfect, but it made a great and memorable gift, and it was an awesome excuse to spend time with my dad working on it.</p>

<h3>My First Post</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m so excited to finally have my own website and brand! The first step towards big things to come. This is just a brief description of what the last couple days have involved with getting a website set up. I&#8217;ll try to explain how I made some of my decisions, what resources worked and which didn&#8217;t, and maybe somebody can benefit from my experience!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190306_183147-e1551916601105-576x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48"/><figcaption>I started it all right from here!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Buying a Domain Name</h3>



<p>I spent all of five minutes deciding on a company name. Having very little notion of what direction this little brand is going, I just decided to make it generic. Fortunately, nobody was sitting on this name. I did trademark and copyright searches, confirmed that nobody was using it on gmail, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, and nobody was using the coveted &#8216;.com&#8217; domain name. I established placeholder accounts on social media sites and then started looking into how to buy a domain name. A couple different services came to the forefront after my research: GoDaddy, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://domains.google.com" target="_blank">Google Domains</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, and the service I ended up using: <a href="http://namecheap.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">NameCheap.</a> They all provide extremely similar services as far as purchasing domains; the differences arise from how easily you&#8217;re able to integrate site hosting and email hosting, and maybe some other features that matter even less to me. NameCheap was the least expensive and had all the features I needed. Ten dollars and a few minutes later I became the proud owner of www.thebrandofben.com for a year.</p>



<h3>Hosting the Website</h3>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, Amazon&#8217;s native service, Google&#8217;s native service, self-hosting my website, or any of the hundreds of other hosts out there? I decided on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. Free hosting, reliable servers, easy to track and revert changes. What&#8217;s the trade-off? It&#8217;s a static site host, so I can&#8217;t use many powerful server tools that come alongside a database focused content management system (CMS). I also won&#8217;t be able to use the wildly popular <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress </a>or <a href="http://squarespace.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SquareSpace </a>with their highly developed user interfaces, user and browser experiences, and extensive customization options. But, by opting for the static site, I have fewer security vulnerabilities, faster browsing speed, and low upkeep. Github Pages also made it very easy to set up routing for my domain and has HTTPS/SSL support integrated free of cost.</p>



<h3>Mail Hosting</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s very cool (and very professional) to have an email address at your own site, like <a href="mailto:bshort@thebrandofben.com">bshort@thebrandofben.com</a>. But what if I want to be able to send from <a href="mailto:newsletter@thebrandofben.com">newsletter@thebrandofben.com</a>? Or I want to get opinions by receiving at <a href="mailto:feedback@thebrandofben.com">feedback@thebrandofben.com</a>? From my admittedly limited research, it appeared that companies charge $2.50-$4.00 per month per account. I don&#8217;t expect to be using &#8216;contact&#8217; or &#8216;info&#8217; or &#8216;support&#8217; often enough for that to make sense, but I&#8217;d like to have those options available to send or receive from. </p>



<p>The reason my research wasn&#8217;t extensive is because I quickly found that Zoho has a mail hosting service. I&#8217;ve used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://sheets.zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho Sheets</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://projects.zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho Projects</a> as part of the Zoho office suite and been blown away by the functionality of their offerings. As soon as I saw that <a href="http://mail.zoho.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Zoho Mail</a> had a free mail hosting option, I pulled the trigger. And I&#8217;m glad I did! They made the fairly technical process of setting up mail routing very easy, and they allowed me to make various aliases to send and receive emails. They also support 2-factor authentication and the mail service is well integrated with the rest of their office suite. Can&#8217;t say enough good things about my experience with Zoho.</p>



<h3>Making a Website!</h3>



<p>This is where I ran into trouble. I don&#8217;t know anything about graphic design or anything but the most rudimentary HTML and CSS. My JavaScript skills are laughable at best! But Github Pages is affiliated with a program called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Jekyll</a>, and they tout it as being able to set up in no time! </p>



<h5>The Static Site Generator Dead Ends</h5>



<p>Uh oh. Turns out it uses Ruby. I haven&#8217;t seen a glimpse of this programming language before. I decided to download it, give it a try, and see if I can get something workable going while learning on the fly. It was quickly clear that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have a serviceable site deployed in, well, the amount of time I was willing to spend to get one started. What else do people use?</p>



<p><a href="http://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Hugo </a>seemed to drum up a lot of enthusiasm online. Looking at their showcase, I was very impressed by what people were able to do with a static HTML site. But as I looked for alternatives, I found an option I thought would suit my needs even better. </p>



<h5>WordPress to Generate a Static Site</h5>



<p>Some absolute saints have developed plugins for WordPress that allow you to create a website, then convert it to static HTML pages, and host those however you see fit. After a botched attempt at local hosting using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://apachefriends.org" target="_blank">XAMPP</a>, I was able to get a local hosting environment set up using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">WAMP</a>. This allows me to test and develop the database-driven WordPress site on my own computer, then deploy a static version to Github Pages. This option severely diminishes the features available, but allows enough customization and aesthetic optimization to suit my needs perfectly well.</p>



<h3>And finally!</h3>



<p>The finished product is what you&#8217;re currently browsing! </p>



<p>I have big dreams and high hopes for this little website and brand new company. I can&#8217;t wait to share more of my projects and develop my brand with the skill-set and values that are important to me.  <br>I hope that the information here interests or helps somebody and I hope you stay in touch to see what&#8217;s next for the Brand of Ben! </p>
