<h4>My Favorite Book: A Writeup</h4>



<p>My favorite book at the moment is The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear by Patrick Rothfuss.  It&#8217;s the second book of his yet-to-be-completed trilogy, The Kingkiller Chronicle. The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear barely edges out its predecessor, The Name of the Wind, as my favorite novel. Some of the complaints I&#8217;ve heard about these books are well founded. The plot meanders. The narrator is unreliable. The protagonist is too good at everything, and his love interest is the worst. True, true, and true! BUT&#8230;</p>



<p>The plot meandering is something I love. Rothfuss puts stories in his stories. It&#8217;s not often I pick up one book and I get 10+ stories for the cost of admission. The narrator being unreliable makes me think twice and second guess everything that he says. The narration, a reminiscence by the protagonist Kvothe, is framed in such a way that he has no incentive to be truthful. He is admittedly a liar and is occasionally demonstrably so in his recounting of the story. Rothfuss hasn&#8217;t taken excessive advantage of this, but uses it brilliantly to make unexpected changes that contradict what the reader expected without building resentment for an intentional deceit. As for the protagonist being too good at everything and his love interest being a terrible character, there is no redemption. I don&#8217;t like either character, actually, but even that doesn&#8217;t detract from my enjoyment of the writing and the world that the books take place in.</p>



<p>What do I love about it? The prose and world-building. While many stories are narratively driven or character driven, this novel is built around how beautifully Rothfuss can write and create a world. He plays with the English language in a masterful way that I&#8217;ve never seen equaled. His plays on words, dualities of meaning, and hints so subtle that I didn&#8217;t recognize them for what they were until I read the book 10 times and had it explained to me twice. And I&#8217;m sure more of those will crawl out of woodwork and show their sneaky selves once book three is ready. His world building assumes an intelligent reader who can connect the dots and understand a complexity that clearly exists in Rothfuss&#8217;s imagination and he translates beautifully into text without encumbering the reader with excessive details.  His magic system is novel, and its functioning fairly explicit. But for me, Rothfuss leaves enough to the reader&#8217;s imagination to not ruin immersion through clear departure from reason or the laws of the universe in which we live. He even makes an effort to incorporate some of those in a way that absolutely works for me. He builds his world through the stories that he weaves in around the main plot, and through subtleties of character interaction, and it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>



<p>I highly recommend this book to fans of the fantasy genre, or anybody whose eye was caught by my description. I hope somebody who reads this finds Patrick Rothfuss&#8217;s Kingkiller Chronicle as enjoyable as I do.<br></p>



<h4>The Book Binding Project!</h4>



<p>I absolutely love working with my hands. A few years ago, I had an idea that my dad and I could work on a project together: binding books in leather. Me for my girlfriend, and him for my stepmom. I chose The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear not realizing that my girlfriend preferred Rothfuss&#8217;s previous book, The Name of the Wind. This was our first foray into book binding, but I did some research into what materials I would need, I mapped out some layouts on a book, and I created a shopping list. I needed: a paperback copy of the book, a big enough piece of scrap leather, some nail sets of various sizes for engraving, a set of 6mm letter stamps, elmer&#8217;s glue, and some wrapping paper for the inner lining. </p>



<p>I got a paperback copy of the book because it&#8217;s cheaper, usually smaller, and the cover has to be torn off anyways to replace it with leather. For leather I got an unfinished single shoulder in 6-7oz weight after checking the size of the paperback copy and calculating the overhang I wanted for the cover. Elmer&#8217;s glue is polyvinyl acetate, the same as common bookbinding adhesive. And for the wrapping paper I decided on an old-fashioned, stylized map. I used an old cereal box cut to the calculated size as a template over which to glue, cut and fold the leather. I had to cut away some material  from the inside of the folds in order to get everything to work decently.</p>



<p>For the designs, I decided on some imagery that was memorable and important to the story that I thought I was capable of tackling. In a format like this where I didn&#8217;t have much control over texture or color, I decided to go with the Cthaeh&#8217;s tree and the Selas flowers. I wish I had taken more pictures during the process as I cut, folded, glued, and dried at each stage. Check out the pictures I do have in the album below!</p>

<p>I was extremely happy with the result of my first attempt at leatherworking and book binding! The result is far from perfect, but it made a great and memorable gift, and it was an awesome excuse to spend time with my dad working on it.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[This is a brief description of how I got my website up and running! From no formal programming experience to creating and administrating my own website. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>My First Post</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m so excited to finally have my own website and brand! The first step towards big things to come. This is just a brief description of what the last couple days have involved with getting a website set up. I&#8217;ll try to explain how I made some of my decisions, what resources worked and which didn&#8217;t, and maybe somebody can benefit from my experience!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190306_183147-e1551916601105-576x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48"/><figcaption>I started it all right from here!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Buying a Domain Name</h3>



<p>I spent all of five minutes deciding on a company name. Having very little notion of what direction this little brand is going, I just decided to make it generic. Fortunately, nobody was sitting on this name. I did trademark and copyright searches, confirmed that nobody was using it on gmail, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, and nobody was using the coveted &#8216;.com&#8217; domain name. I established placeholder accounts on social media sites and then started looking into how to buy a domain name. A couple different services came to the forefront after my research: GoDaddy, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://domains.google.com" target="_blank">Google Domains</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, and the service I ended up using: <a href="http://namecheap.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">NameCheap.</a> They all provide extremely similar services as far as purchasing domains; the differences arise from how easily you&#8217;re able to integrate site hosting and email hosting, and maybe some other features that matter even less to me. NameCheap was the least expensive and had all the features I needed. Ten dollars and a few minutes later I became the proud owner of www.thebrandofben.com for a year.</p>



<h3>Hosting the Website</h3>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, Amazon&#8217;s native service, Google&#8217;s native service, self-hosting my website, or any of the hundreds of other hosts out there? I decided on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. Free hosting, reliable servers, easy to track and revert changes. What&#8217;s the trade-off? It&#8217;s a static site host, so I can&#8217;t use many powerful server tools that come alongside a database focused content management system (CMS). I also won&#8217;t be able to use the wildly popular <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress </a>or <a href="http://squarespace.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SquareSpace </a>with their highly developed user interfaces, user and browser experiences, and extensive customization options. But, by opting for the static site, I have fewer security vulnerabilities, faster browsing speed, and low upkeep. Github Pages also made it very easy to set up routing for my domain and has HTTPS/SSL support integrated free of cost.</p>



<h3>Mail Hosting</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s very cool (and very professional) to have an email address at your own site, like <a href="mailto:bshort@thebrandofben.com">bshort@thebrandofben.com</a>. But what if I want to be able to send from <a href="mailto:newsletter@thebrandofben.com">newsletter@thebrandofben.com</a>? Or I want to get opinions by receiving at <a href="mailto:feedback@thebrandofben.com">feedback@thebrandofben.com</a>? From my admittedly limited research, it appeared that companies charge $2.50-$4.00 per month per account. I don&#8217;t expect to be using &#8216;contact&#8217; or &#8216;info&#8217; or &#8216;support&#8217; often enough for that to make sense, but I&#8217;d like to have those options available to send or receive from. </p>



<p>The reason my research wasn&#8217;t extensive is because I quickly found that Zoho has a mail hosting service. I&#8217;ve used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://sheets.zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho Sheets</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://projects.zoho.com" target="_blank">Zoho Projects</a> as part of the Zoho office suite and been blown away by the functionality of their offerings. As soon as I saw that <a href="http://mail.zoho.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Zoho Mail</a> had a free mail hosting option, I pulled the trigger. And I&#8217;m glad I did! They made the fairly technical process of setting up mail routing very easy, and they allowed me to make various aliases to send and receive emails. They also support 2-factor authentication and the mail service is well integrated with the rest of their office suite. Can&#8217;t say enough good things about my experience with Zoho.</p>



<h3>Making a Website!</h3>



<p>This is where I ran into trouble. I don&#8217;t know anything about graphic design or anything but the most rudimentary HTML and CSS. My JavaScript skills are laughable at best! But Github Pages is affiliated with a program called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Jekyll</a>, and they tout it as being able to set up in no time! </p>



<h5>The Static Site Generator Dead Ends</h5>



<p>Uh oh. Turns out it uses Ruby. I haven&#8217;t seen a glimpse of this programming language before. I decided to download it, give it a try, and see if I can get something workable going while learning on the fly. It was quickly clear that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have a serviceable site deployed in, well, the amount of time I was willing to spend to get one started. What else do people use?</p>



<p><a href="http://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Hugo </a>seemed to drum up a lot of enthusiasm online. Looking at their showcase, I was very impressed by what people were able to do with a static HTML site. But as I looked for alternatives, I found an option I thought would suit my needs even better. </p>



<h5>WordPress to Generate a Static Site</h5>



<p>Some absolute saints have developed plugins for WordPress that allow you to create a website, then convert it to static HTML pages, and host those however you see fit. After a botched attempt at local hosting using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://apachefriends.org" target="_blank">XAMPP</a>, I was able to get a local hosting environment set up using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">WAMP</a>. This allows me to test and develop the database-driven WordPress site on my own computer, then deploy a static version to Github Pages. This option severely diminishes the features available, but allows enough customization and aesthetic optimization to suit my needs perfectly well.</p>



<h3>And finally!</h3>



<p>The finished product is what you&#8217;re currently browsing! </p>



<p>I have big dreams and high hopes for this little website and brand new company. I can&#8217;t wait to share more of my projects and develop my brand with the skill-set and values that are important to me.  <br>I hope that the information here interests or helps somebody and I hope you stay in touch to see what&#8217;s next for the Brand of Ben! </p>
