<p><a href="#Day1">Day 1 &#8211; Mt LeConte via Alum Cave Bluffs</a><br><a href="#Day2">Day 2 &#8211; Rainbow Falls</a><br><a href="#Day3">Day 3 &#8211; Old Settlers Trail</a></p>



<p>To celebrate the beginning of spring, my birthday, and just as an excuse to see friends that live too far apart, we decided to go on a weekend trip to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We got an awesome little cabin up in the mountains about a ten minute drive from the downtown area. Over the next few days we ate delicious food, enjoyed great company, and explored a bit of the beautiful Great Smokey Mountains National Park.</p>



<h3 id="Day1">Day 1 &#8211; Saturday, March 30th &#8211; Mt LeConte via Alum Cave Bluffs</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000-1024x238.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-756" width="1024" height="238" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000.jpg 1024w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000-300x70.jpg 300w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190403-WA0000-768x179.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Panorama of all four of us atop Mount LeConte&#8217;s Myrtle Point!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Morgan, Cece, Danny and I parked at the Alum Cave Bluffs Trailhead just after 9am to hike probably the most popular mountain in the area: Mount LeConte. The weather looked absolutely perfect for a hike, with the high down in the valley forecast in the mid-70s. Saturdays are a busy day on popular routes like this, but we found parking and got started with no trouble at all. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-760" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190330_092432_optimized-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Arch Rock, about 1 mile in</figcaption></figure>



<p>I didn&#8217;t take many pictures on the way up, but I managed to snap a few before the burn set in and the smiles started to fade. Arch Rock is the first cool landmark that we saw, as pictured above, and you climb right through this very unique formation. The next notable photo op we passed was the Alum Cave Bluffs themselves. I thought it was so neat to be able to look straight up and see trees growing directly above me, and some melt from the higher elevations was dripping down and getting carried in interesting patterns by the crazy wind currents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-763" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG-20190330-WA0001_optimized.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption>Are they just taking a break, or rethinking the rest of the elevation gain?</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Alum Cave Bluffs are just under 2.5 miles in. They&#8217;re a perfect turnaround point if you haven&#8217;t sweated out enough Gatlinburg moonshine to climb another 1600&#8242; of elevation. I didn&#8217;t take many pictures on the way up the mountain, but a few times we would climb around a bend or through a gap in the trees and I would have to stop to snap a few. No need to upload those, though. As is often the case on hikes I took the pictures not knowing that the view from the top blew them out of the water.<br></p>

<p>We reached the summit at 11:40, so it took us about two and a half hours to get to the top. I&#8217;m so glad we went the extra 3/4 miles to Myrtle Point. Almost no elevation change, but a lot fewer hikers, a very cool trail as you approach the point, and incredible views. We munched on some ham &amp; cheese sandwiches and coconut and cashew snacks from Costco before heading back down the mountain. </p>

<p>We hopped in our cabin&#8217;s hot tub with some beers to recover from the hike. Later we headed into town for some eats and Gatlinburg moonshine.</p>

<h3 id="Day2">Day 2 &#8211; Sunday, March 31st &#8211; Rainbow Falls Hike</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG-20190403-WA0003_optimized.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG-20190403-WA0003_optimized-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-790" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG-20190403-WA0003_optimized.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG-20190403-WA0003_optimized-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption>My favorite (goofy) picture of the day. Up at the falls where the snow is sticking. Is there a better way to spend a day?</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, Cece and Danny couldn&#8217;t stick around for another day. We spent the morning with them wandering around downtown before setting off for our afternoon hike. We decided to hike a different face of Mt LeConte up to a waterfall called Rainbow Falls. The weather was a bit chillier but that has never stopped me from enjoying a hike before! Just got to have the right gear.</p>

<iframe src="https://caltopo.com/m/HVGR" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>



<p>This shows the topo of the hike. If you zoom out just a little you can see the hike from the previous day just a couple miles southeast of this one!</p>



<h3 id="Day3">Day 3 &#8211; Monday, April 1st &#8211; Old Settler&#8217;s Trail</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190401_185528_optimized.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190401_185528_optimized-e1557337862462-576x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-791" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190401_185528_optimized-e1557337862462-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190401_185528_optimized-e1557337862462-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190401_185528_optimized-e1557337862462-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190401_185528_optimized-e1557337862462.jpg 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a><figcaption>This picture sums up the hike pretty nicely. This was within a mile of the end and we were spent!</figcaption></figure>



<p>We started this 17.2 mile doozy from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Maddron Bald Trailhead (opens in a new tab)" href="https://goo.gl/maps/UgJ595rWjUEB9cZf9" target="_blank">Maddron Bald Trailhead</a> a little ways out of town after dropping one car off at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HkXt8KDFw1Ndf6Mf6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Grapeyard Ridge Trailhead</a>. We weren&#8217;t totally sure how long the hike was going to be, as different sources quoted different hike lengths. We got a late start, hiking from Maddron Bald Trailhead at 1230 pm and Morgan was stressing that we wouldn&#8217;t make it while it was still light out. When we got to the first trail marker it showed that the total mileage would be 17.2 total and that ended up being dead on according to our phones.</p>



<iframe src="https://albumizr.com/a/-ZIU" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" width="700" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p>I didn&#8217;t take as many pictures on this one. There&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a great write-up on the Great Smoky Mountains National Park website (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gsmnp.com/old-settlers-trail/" target="_blank">a great write-up on the Great Smoky Mountains National Park website</a>! To me it was a great balance between well-maintained and slightly overgrown. Bridges were functional but I felt like getting out of town much more than the very busy Mt LeConte trails.</p>



<p>Overall, Gatlinburg was a great experience and the weather and views from the top of Mt LeConte were the most stunning I&#8217;ve seen in the US. The infrastructure is well developed and there are hike options for those of most skill levels to get up to the top of the mountain!</p>

<p>On March 15th, I met up with my friend Pat halfway between Charlottesville and NoVa for a hike.  The forecast called for clear, sunny skies with a high of 70 down in the valley. Just about perfect hiking weather! We decided to meet up at Thornton Gap because of the similar drive times for each of us, but we didn&#8217;t really have a hike in mind.  I had a preference to start down at the bottom of the gap to avoid paying the entry fee onto Skyline Drive, but other than that I figured we would plan it when we arrived. I didn&#8217;t realize that we would have no signal and my offline maps didn&#8217;t include that region! I thought I remembered seeing trails that led to the ridge-line north and south of Route 211, so I knew that we should be able to make a loop of things. I also had the idea in mind that we should try to make it to Mary&#8217;s Rock, as that is supposed to have phenomenal views of the area.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/terrain-profile.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-129" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/terrain-profile.jpg 800w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/terrain-profile-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/terrain-profile-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>We met up at the lower parking lot, farther east on 211. We left my car there and drove up to the next parking lot in Pat&#8217;s. We set off across the road and up Pass Mountain Trail, with occasional views across the gap of our beautiful and somewhat intimidating goal for the day: Mary&#8217;s Rock. We enjoyed great trail conditions and a steady reasonable climb for 2.7 miles until we reached the Pass Mountain Hut. Another 0.2 miles got us to the Appalachian Trail, where we turned left to go southbound. The trail took us down into Thornton Gap where we had two low-traffic road crossings and a view of Mary&#8217;s Rock shooting up above us.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-942x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-131" srcset="https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-942x1024.jpg 942w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-276x300.jpg 276w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-768x835.jpg 768w, https://www.thebrandofben.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190315_133641-cropped-1600x1740.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px" /><figcaption>Mary&#8217;s Rock from Thornton Gap</figcaption></figure>



<p>From there it was a serious (and seriously fun) climb up the mountain. We passed a family with a little guy, 10ish, who looked ready to quit, and another couple wearing jeans who I felt even worse for. There were a couple icy sections next to drop offs that I wasn&#8217;t expecting to find after the recent weather, but nothing else of note on the way up. Once to the top there&#8217;s a beautiful vista, but it looked like we could get even higher by scrambling up some of the rocks so we stopped for long enough to throw on windbreakers and started climbing. Atop the highest of these, we found a little USGS marker letting us know we had reached the summit! This was Pat&#8217;s first peak achieved in the U.S. and what an incredible day for it.</p>

<p>We spent 30-35 minutes at the top loving life, chatting, and eating snacks. There&#8217;s nowhere I would rather spend a beautiful Friday than hiking with good friends and relaxing on top of mountains. That&#8217;s the dream. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, we eventually had to start heading down from there. We thought we heard people passing by on the trail just behind the peak, so instead of backtracking, we bushwhacked down to the trail. We turned at the next intersection we saw, hoping it was the right place, and followed Meadow Spring Trail down to Skyline Drive. This part of the hike was uneventful, with a few valley views but nothing that compared to the view from the top. We crossed Skyline and proceeded down Buck Hollow Trail to my car, paralleling and occasionally crossing the stream that ran through the hollow.</p>



<p>Overall, the hike was amazing as a day hike for many reasons: it&#8217;s a perfect distance from each of us, the trail was nice, packed dirt for the vast majority, the views from the top were amazing, the distance was just right, and we were able to make the hike a loop. Overall, it was an absolute stunner.</p>
